              " 'body_text': ['The pandemic illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the identification of numerous common neurologic complications, which may result directly or indirectly from infection [1] . The most well-known neurologic symptom is anosmia/dysgeusia (loss of sense of smell/taste) [2] whose uniqueness to SARS-CoV-2 has been debated [3] ; involvement of skeletal muscles is also very common and fortunately mild in most cases (predominantly myalgias), although myositis and rhabdomyolysis are described [4, 5] . Rarely, more significant neurologic complications arise [6] . In the central nervous system, some of the described phenotypes include encephalopathy [7] , neuroimmunological syndromes [8] , and myoclonus/ataxia [9] . Ischemic stroke appears to have a more severe outcome in COVID-19 patients but was not more common in a recent large series [10] . Peripheral nervous system complications mainly relate to above-mentioned complications of skeletal muscle, as well as variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome [11] [12] [13] . Mononeuritis multiplex has been described with high prevalence in a series of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [14] , which is a group of patients in whom neurologic impairments may be difficult to identify and may be misattributed to critical illness neuro/ myopathy. When present, neurologic syndromes have been associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients [15] . SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein found abundantly among numerous cell types including neurones of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and muscle [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, neurologic complications may occur as a direct consequence of viral infection, in addition to neurologic damage resulting from hypoxia, the inflammatory cascade, and other end-organ injuries. As a result, there is concern that patients with pre-existing neurological disorders may be at greater risk of neurological complications, or more severe outcomes in general from COVID-19 [19] . Recent evidence indicates more severe outcomes may occur in patients with common pre-existing neurological disorders [20] . It is more challenging to study the impact of COVID-19 on rare diseases (a large group of individually rare, but collectively common disorders, approximately one-third of which are neurologic) [21] . The available evidence certainly demonstrates a major impact of the pandemic on patients with rare disease in numerous domains [22, 23] , including mental health, physical health, and access to care among others. Shifts in healthcare resources to address pandemic needs have directly impacted the care of patients with chronic neurologic conditions [24] . For some specific rare disorders there is evidence for an increased risk of poor outcomes. For example, in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), the mortality risk is markedly increased compared with the general population [25] . Preliminary evidence from a myasthenia gravis registry suggests severe outcomes may be frequent [26] . Expert opinions agree that many neuromuscular conditions are likely to be associated with increased risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection [27]. This is a highly rational conclusion because patients with neuromuscular disorders are at high risk from pulmonary infections in general [28] , and can have compromised respiratory muscle strength at various stages of disease [29] . While there is otherwise limited evidence for specific rare disorders, there is evidence that broader groups of patients, such as those with intellectual and developmental disability, may have more severe outcomes [30] .  Persons with neurologic disabilities may have increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (due to carers entering the home) [31] , have reduced access to public health information and health services [32] , and have additional challenges during hospitalization if visits from family and other supports are restricted [33] . There is also a bioethical concern that forthcoming intensive care unit (ICU) rationing guidelines [34] could deprioritize the care of those with neurological disorders hospitalized with COVID-19 [35] . The impetus to deprioritized care must be considered in light of regular lack of synchronicity between patient and practitioners\\' definitions and assumptions of what constitutes \"quality of life\" with a disability [36] [37] [38] [39] . Bureaucratic barriers, such as a focus on recipients of chronic home care as opposed to diagnosis-based priority for phase 1 inoculation, leaves those living with and receiving care from family off priority lists in some municipalities. These decisions are often driven by studies regarding the impact of COVID-19 on persons with disabilities that may be limited due to systemic problems with how data in these populations are collected [40] . Within these communities, individuals have been advised to exercise heightened levels of precaution and vigilance [41] , which may result in lower infection numbers and misleading conclusions that patients with neurologic and rare disorders are not at high risk. There have been calls to prioritize COVID-19 vaccination in persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities [42] . We here suggest that persons with other neurological disorders and rare diseases should also be considered a priority group for vaccination. Neurologic and rare disorders are not considered one of the major risk factors for severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection; nonetheless the evidence clearly shows these patients are vulnerable to direct complications of the virus in addition to elevated risks of exposure due to home care needs and the potential for deprioritized care should they become infected during surging ICU admissions. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which are more transmissible [43] and virulent [44] , adds to the immediacy of this issue. For all these reasons, there is an urgent need to prioritize protecting those with neurologic and rare disorders from contracting COVID-19.'],\n",

              " 'body_text': ['Testing for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an essential part of the pandemic control [1] . Millions of individuals are tested daily as a part of mass testing strategies to identify and isolate asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in society [2] . For initial SARS-CoV-2 infections, an upper respiratory tract specimen is recommended to be collected for molecular or antigen testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends performing oropharyngeal (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) to ensure the collection of representative upper respiratory tract specimens for COVID-19 testing [3] . Proper specimen collection is considered the most important step in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 and suboptimal technique may lead to false-negative test results [4] . The test procedures can be technically difficult to perform, and due to the significant and unmet need for healthcare workers at the many community-based COVID-19 test sites, non-healthcare workers may also be used to collect upper respiratory tract specimens [5, 6] . Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the test administrators have the necessary skills to collect high-quality clinical specimens, and competency-based training should provide the skills needed. A pre-requisite for competency-based training is an assessment tool with established validity evidence for evaluating upper respiratory specimen sampling techniques at the COVID-19 test sites. This study aims to develop and examine the validity of theoretical and practical skills tests for obtaining nasopharyngeal (NPS) and oropharyngeal (OPS) specimen collection for COVID-19 testing. We conducted an experimental study to assess skills in obtaining NPS and OPS using Messick\\'s validity framework, which complies with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing guidelines [7] . A multiple-choice test (MCQ) and checklists following the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to assess NPS and OPS performance were constructed, and experts and novices were invited to participate in a validation study. Psychometric data from the study were used to explore five sources of validity evidence according to Messick\\'s validity framework: content evidence, response process, internal structure, relationships with other variables, and test consequences. A MCQ and a checklist for upper respiratory tract specimens\\' collection skills (URTS) were developed as an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format test with content evidence obtained through two steps. First, we used the technical guide from the WHO together with an additional literature review to ensure the contents of the URTS MCQ, and the URTS checklist followed international recommendations [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . We then recruited a multidisciplinary board of experts constituted by a consultant in rhinology (CvB), a consultant in head and neck surgery (JM), a consultant in infectious disease (TB), a microbiology specialist (NK), and a medical education scientist (MT) to review the content of each item on the checklist. The items were revised and re-evaluated until consensus was reached among the expert panel. Participants without any formal healthcare education were recruited to participate in the study as novices representing the competence level of general staff that could be hired in public-based COVID-19 sites for mass-testing. Their performances were assessed in a simulated setting before receiving OPS and NPS training and again afterward to measure the effect of the training session. We invited consultants and registrars (PGY-2 or more) in otolaryngology to participate in the study as the expert group. These were chosen as experts due to their anatomical knowledge and experience with procedures within the upper respiratory tract. The theoretical test was constructed as MCQ questions with three possible answers, with only one answer being correct. Some of the questions also included pictures or Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 3 of 10 anatomical animations. Printed papers with the MCQ questions were provided to all the participants who were not allowed to use handbooks, access web resources, or ask for help during the MCQ test. Each correct answer gave one point, whereas incorrect answers gave zero points. The practical test with OPS and NPS sampling techniques was conducted using a simulation-based context. A checklist was developed for the OPS and NPS sample assessing the different sub-elements of the procedures performed correctly (one point) or incorrectly (zero points). The oropharyngeal sampling was performed on a life-sized airway demonstration model (Airsim Advance Crico, Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) with a flexible endoscope (aScope 4 RhinoLaryngo, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to visualize the oropharyngeal swab technique on a video monitor (aView, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) during the procedure (see Figure 1 ). The NPS was performed on a 3D-printed simulator based on real CT scans with correct anatomic landmarks [17] . The 3D simulator model was slightly modified for the project as we added ears on the simulator head, which is important guidance for the nasopharyngeal sample (see Figure 1 ).

A power-point presentation demonstrated upper-airway anatomy and the steps in the techniques for performing OPS and NPS. The novices then observed a video from WHO demonstrating the technique on a real person [18] . The training session ended with hands-on practice of OPS and NPS on the simulation models described previously with feedback from the teacher. A post-training assessment was conducted with a theoretical MCQ test followed by an assessment of OPS and NPS performance on the simulators without any guidance from the teacher. The novices answered the MCQ test and performed OPS and NPS on the simulators before (pretest) and again after training (posttest). The expert group also answered the MCQ and performed OPS and NPS on the same simulators, and all performances were Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 4 of 10 video recorded for subsequent assessment with the URTS checklist. A nurse (RCE) and resident in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (LH) rated all the videos independently. Prior to the rating, a 30-min rater training session was conducted. They watched four pilot videos (not being a part of the assessment videos used in the study) and discussed any disagreement in their URTS checklist ratings. Then, the two raters assessed all the videos using the URTS checklist in a randomized order and blinded to who had received training. To evaluate internal structure of the constructed MCQ, item statistics including item difficulty index and item discriminatory index were calculated. MCQs with appropriate testing properties were selected to be included in the test and internal consistency reliability was calculated as Cronbach\\'s alpha. Inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute agreement definition, was used for measuring inter-rater reliability, and Cronbach\\'s alpha was used to evaluate the internal structure of the final items on checklists. The \"relations to other variables\" validity evidence were explored by comparing the MCQ and checklist scores between groups. The test scores discriminatory abilities between experts and untrained/trained novices were explored with independent samples t-tests and the effect of the training was determined using a paired samples t-test. The contrasting groups\\' method [19] was used to explore the \"test consequences\" and establish the pass/fail levels of both tests to determine who is ready for independent practice. We examined the consequences of these criteria for both tests using the postcourse test scores to determine the proportion of newly trained non-healthcare professionals having completed the combined theoretical and hands-on course that passed and failed the tests, respectively. All the statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package (PASW, version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and two-sided significance levels of 0.05 were used for all analyses. Twenty-four novices without any healthcare education agreed to participate in the study and 16 experts who were registrars or consultants in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery working either at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Zealand University Hospital, Køge or Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. All 24 novices were both pre-and post-tested while the 16 experts only were tested once. In total, results from 64 URTS MCQ tests and 128 videos of OPS and NPS performance were available for assessment with the URTS checklist. The URTS MCQ and the URTS checklist items were based on the WHO recommendations and revised based on content matter expert reviews. Based on the comments by the expert review, nine of the fourteen MCQ questions were revised, and one new item was added. Item analysis showed that 12 out of 15 items had acceptable item discriminatory indices of 0.18 or above, whereas the remaining three had indices below 0.04 and were removed from the final test. Five of the 17 URTS checklist items for OPS and NPS performance were revised to the final version approved by all the experts and used for the study (see Appendix A). All MCQ tests were administered in a standardized fashion without allowing the participants any guidance. After completing a half-hour rater training, the raters were able to conduct assessments using both OPS and NPS checklists without any missing values. The two raters reported no difficulty in performing ratings in the simulated context despite dissimilarities between the simulated and clinical procedure (e.g., no head movements during insertion of swabs or interaction with the patient). The internal consistency reliability of the MCQ test was 0.76. The URTS checklist score demonstrated good inter-rater reliability for OPS and NPS skills assessment of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. Internal consistency reliabilities for both instruments were high, Cronbach\\'s alpha 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. The URTS MCQ-test score was significant higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The novices scored higher after training (p < 0.001) but still significantly lower than the experts (p = 0.008).  This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. The URTS checklist score was significantly higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 for both OPS and NPS (see Table 1 ). The novices scored higher after both NPS and OPS training (p < 0.001) but not significantly lower than the experts when the OPS score (p = 0.14) and the NPS score (p = 0.49) were compared (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The contrasting groups\\' method established an MCQ-test pass/fail score of 91% and a checklist pass/fail score of the 76% for OPS and 61% for NPS, see Figure 2 . The consequences of the standard setting were that thirteen of the trained novices failed MCQtest while only one failed the competency-based assessment with the URTS checklist (see Figure 2 and Table 1 ). This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. Sources of validity evidence were explored in this study following Messick\\'s validity framework. The content of the checklist was based on literature review and multi-speciality expert consensus. The response process was ensured by controlled testing environments, rater training, and the anatomical correct simulators used in the testing setup. A high inter-rater and inter-item reliability supported the internal structure validity evidence for both the MCQ-test and checklists. Relations to other variables were supported by the URTS MCQ and checklist ability to differentiate between novice and expert experience levels and the ability to measure an effect from 30 min training of the novices. The consequences of the test were explored by a standard setting establishing a meaningful pass/fail score. The finding that a group of trained novices did not obtain a significant lower URTS checklist score to compare to a group of experts may be surprising at first. However, previous studies have shown that experts often do not adhere strictly to detailed checklists compared with trained intermediate learners [20] although they are better at providing accurate overall diagnoses. However, COVID-testing is a relatively simple procedure requiring limited and relatively elementary knowledge and skills, which may indicate a short learning curve that combined with the standardized simulated model may have resulted in some level of ceiling effects. The good effect of a short simulation-based URTS training is also comparable to other studies with similar findings [21, 22] . This indicates that URTS is a well-defined procedure where non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts if they receive focused and standardized training [23] . In this study, we assessed both OPS and NPS performance as WHO recommends combining both samples for each case to increase the diagnostic sensitivity [3] . In contrast, CDC primarily recommends a single NPS sample while other studies have questioned the OPS sensitivity [4, 24, 25] . If a single NPS specimen is used for testing purpose, the NPS checklist can just be used, and the OPS checklist can instead be omitted. The URTS assessment was developed in relation to the urgent need during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use is not limited to coronavirus diagnostic but can also be used for other upper respiratory infectious diseases. We found a high inter-rater reliability between the nurse and otolaryngologist checklist ratings, supporting the use of nurses instead of physicians for the practical testing and training of the large groups of workers involved in mass testing. Therefore, we believe the URTS MCQ-test and checklists can be used as part of training of new health-care workers at the outpatient COVID-19 testing sites and at the hospital. Further, it can also be used for training of laypersons needed in mass-testing strategies where the limitation of health workers during a pandemic will not be able to cover the test needs. The checklist was made Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 7 of 10 in an OSCE format and could also be used as a part of clinical skills assessment at medical and nursing schools. The findings of the study should be interpreted in accordance with the following limitations. The study was performed in a simulation-based setting, and we cannot know if the skills are directly transferable to how they would collect URT-specimens in an outpatient test site. However, a large body of existing literature supports the use of simulation-based assessment and training of clinical skills, and numerous studies have shown good correlations between performances in the simulated and clinical setting [26, 27] . Moreover, in a clinical setting it will not be possible for the rater to see the intraoral OPS sampling technique which we instead could visualize with a video endoscope in the simulated setting for more complete assessment of sample technique (see Figure 1) . A critical part of the NPS specimen collection is whether the swab reach the nasopharyngeal wall which require an insertion length between 8-11 cm [9] . However, the rater could not directly visualize if the swab reached the nasopharyngeal wall during the test participants performance on the NPS simulator model. Nevertheless, as the model has known realistic anatomy proportions it could be seen if the swab was inserted to high and trapped before at the midturbinates instead, see Figure 1 [9, 17] . The aim of this URTS skills assessment is to ensure URT-specimens collection performance performed with correct infection control precautions. However, the URTS-skills assessment do not cover the full infection prevention and control competencies needed for health workers within infectious diseases and it should be covered by focused training and competency assessment within this area [28] . Further, the URTS-checklist focuses on the skills assessment needed for collecting specimens for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Therefore, the NPS checklist should be combined with assessment of the on-site handling of the lateral flow immunoassay if it is used as a part of competency-based training in antigen testing [29] . The use of assessment instruments with established validity evidence is a cornerstone in the provision of competency-based URT-specimen collecting training of healthcare workers during the pandemic. However, until now the training and assessment of personnel performing URT-specimen collecting have received limited attention despite its importance for overall diagnostic accuracy of the tests used. A study found that NPS simulation training significantly can improve healthcare workers\\' confidence, but the change performance was not assessed [30] . There has been a large emphasis on comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different test types (e.g., antigen vs. molecular tests) and different sampling sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal vs. saliva), and more focus should also be on the URT-specimen collecting technique and training [31, 32] . Future research and practice must incorporate descriptions of how the sampling procedure is performed and the test personnel are assessed and trained to ensure standardization and reproducibility of test design. This also applies to self-collected URT samples which can be an effective method for mass testing in future [33, 34] . We established validity evidence supporting the use of a theoretical and practical test for upper respiratory specimens\\' collection skills based on the recommendations by the WHO. Further, the results indicate that non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts after a short and focused simulation-based training session. This is the first step to enable competency-based training of the workers in the COVID-19 test centers as well as for health-care workers performing URT samples for other infectious diseases.

              " 'body_text': ['Testing for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an essential part of the pandemic control [1] . Millions of individuals are tested daily as a part of mass testing strategies to identify and isolate asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in society [2] . For initial SARS-CoV-2 infections, an upper respiratory tract specimen is recommended to be collected for molecular or antigen testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends performing oropharyngeal (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) to ensure the collection of representative upper respiratory tract specimens for COVID-19 testing [3] . Proper specimen collection is considered the most important step in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 and suboptimal technique may lead to false-negative test results [4] . The test procedures can be technically difficult to perform, and due to the significant and unmet need for healthcare workers at the many community-based COVID-19 test sites, non-healthcare workers may also be used to collect upper respiratory tract specimens [5, 6] . Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the test administrators have the necessary skills to collect high-quality clinical specimens, and competency-based training should provide the skills needed. A pre-requisite for competency-based training is an assessment tool with established validity evidence for evaluating upper respiratory specimen sampling techniques at the COVID-19 test sites. This study aims to develop and examine the validity of theoretical and practical skills tests for obtaining nasopharyngeal (NPS) and oropharyngeal (OPS) specimen collection for COVID-19 testing. We conducted an experimental study to assess skills in obtaining NPS and OPS using Messick\\'s validity framework, which complies with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing guidelines [7] . A multiple-choice test (MCQ) and checklists following the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to assess NPS and OPS performance were constructed, and experts and novices were invited to participate in a validation study. Psychometric data from the study were used to explore five sources of validity evidence according to Messick\\'s validity framework: content evidence, response process, internal structure, relationships with other variables, and test consequences. A MCQ and a checklist for upper respiratory tract specimens\\' collection skills (URTS) were developed as an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format test with content evidence obtained through two steps. First, we used the technical guide from the WHO together with an additional literature review to ensure the contents of the URTS MCQ, and the URTS checklist followed international recommendations [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . We then recruited a multidisciplinary board of experts constituted by a consultant in rhinology (CvB), a consultant in head and neck surgery (JM), a consultant in infectious disease (TB), a microbiology specialist (NK), and a medical education scientist (MT) to review the content of each item on the checklist. The items were revised and re-evaluated until consensus was reached among the expert panel. Participants without any formal healthcare education were recruited to participate in the study as novices representing the competence level of general staff that could be hired in public-based COVID-19 sites for mass-testing. Their performances were assessed in a simulated setting before receiving OPS and NPS training and again afterward to measure the effect of the training session. We invited consultants and registrars (PGY-2 or more) in otolaryngology to participate in the study as the expert group. These were chosen as experts due to their anatomical knowledge and experience with procedures within the upper respiratory tract. The theoretical test was constructed as MCQ questions with three possible answers, with only one answer being correct. Some of the questions also included pictures or Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 3 of 10 anatomical animations. Printed papers with the MCQ questions were provided to all the participants who were not allowed to use handbooks, access web resources, or ask for help during the MCQ test. Each correct answer gave one point, whereas incorrect answers gave zero points. The practical test with OPS and NPS sampling techniques was conducted using a simulation-based context. A checklist was developed for the OPS and NPS sample assessing the different sub-elements of the procedures performed correctly (one point) or incorrectly (zero points). The oropharyngeal sampling was performed on a life-sized airway demonstration model (Airsim Advance Crico, Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) with a flexible endoscope (aScope 4 RhinoLaryngo, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to visualize the oropharyngeal swab technique on a video monitor (aView, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) during the procedure (see Figure 1 ). The NPS was performed on a 3D-printed simulator based on real CT scans with correct anatomic landmarks [17] . The 3D simulator model was slightly modified for the project as we added ears on the simulator head, which is important guidance for the nasopharyngeal sample (see Figure 1 ).

A power-point presentation demonstrated upper-airway anatomy and the steps in the techniques for performing OPS and NPS. The novices then observed a video from WHO demonstrating the technique on a real person [18] . The training session ended with hands-on practice of OPS and NPS on the simulation models described previously with feedback from the teacher. A post-training assessment was conducted with a theoretical MCQ test followed by an assessment of OPS and NPS performance on the simulators without any guidance from the teacher. The novices answered the MCQ test and performed OPS and NPS on the simulators before (pretest) and again after training (posttest). The expert group also answered the MCQ and performed OPS and NPS on the same simulators, and all performances were Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 4 of 10 video recorded for subsequent assessment with the URTS checklist. A nurse (RCE) and resident in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (LH) rated all the videos independently. Prior to the rating, a 30-min rater training session was conducted. They watched four pilot videos (not being a part of the assessment videos used in the study) and discussed any disagreement in their URTS checklist ratings. Then, the two raters assessed all the videos using the URTS checklist in a randomized order and blinded to who had received training. To evaluate internal structure of the constructed MCQ, item statistics including item difficulty index and item discriminatory index were calculated. MCQs with appropriate testing properties were selected to be included in the test and internal consistency reliability was calculated as Cronbach\\'s alpha. Inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute agreement definition, was used for measuring inter-rater reliability, and Cronbach\\'s alpha was used to evaluate the internal structure of the final items on checklists. The \"relations to other variables\" validity evidence were explored by comparing the MCQ and checklist scores between groups. The test scores discriminatory abilities between experts and untrained/trained novices were explored with independent samples t-tests and the effect of the training was determined using a paired samples t-test. The contrasting groups\\' method [19] was used to explore the \"test consequences\" and establish the pass/fail levels of both tests to determine who is ready for independent practice. We examined the consequences of these criteria for both tests using the postcourse test scores to determine the proportion of newly trained non-healthcare professionals having completed the combined theoretical and hands-on course that passed and failed the tests, respectively. All the statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package (PASW, version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and two-sided significance levels of 0.05 were used for all analyses. Twenty-four novices without any healthcare education agreed to participate in the study and 16 experts who were registrars or consultants in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery working either at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Zealand University Hospital, Køge or Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. All 24 novices were both pre-and post-tested while the 16 experts only were tested once. In total, results from 64 URTS MCQ tests and 128 videos of OPS and NPS performance were available for assessment with the URTS checklist. The URTS MCQ and the URTS checklist items were based on the WHO recommendations and revised based on content matter expert reviews. Based on the comments by the expert review, nine of the fourteen MCQ questions were revised, and one new item was added. Item analysis showed that 12 out of 15 items had acceptable item discriminatory indices of 0.18 or above, whereas the remaining three had indices below 0.04 and were removed from the final test. Five of the 17 URTS checklist items for OPS and NPS performance were revised to the final version approved by all the experts and used for the study (see Appendix A). All MCQ tests were administered in a standardized fashion without allowing the participants any guidance. After completing a half-hour rater training, the raters were able to conduct assessments using both OPS and NPS checklists without any missing values. The two raters reported no difficulty in performing ratings in the simulated context despite dissimilarities between the simulated and clinical procedure (e.g., no head movements during insertion of swabs or interaction with the patient). The internal consistency reliability of the MCQ test was 0.76. The URTS checklist score demonstrated good inter-rater reliability for OPS and NPS skills assessment of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. Internal consistency reliabilities for both instruments were high, Cronbach\\'s alpha 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. The URTS MCQ-test score was significant higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The novices scored higher after training (p < 0.001) but still significantly lower than the experts (p = 0.008).  This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. The URTS checklist score was significantly higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 for both OPS and NPS (see Table 1 ). The novices scored higher after both NPS and OPS training (p < 0.001) but not significantly lower than the experts when the OPS score (p = 0.14) and the NPS score (p = 0.49) were compared (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The contrasting groups\\' method established an MCQ-test pass/fail score of 91% and a checklist pass/fail score of the 76% for OPS and 61% for NPS, see Figure 2 . The consequences of the standard setting were that thirteen of the trained novices failed MCQtest while only one failed the competency-based assessment with the URTS checklist (see Figure 2 and Table 1 ). This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. Sources of validity evidence were explored in this study following Messick\\'s validity framework. The content of the checklist was based on literature review and multi-speciality expert consensus. The response process was ensured by controlled testing environments, rater training, and the anatomical correct simulators used in the testing setup. A high inter-rater and inter-item reliability supported the internal structure validity evidence for both the MCQ-test and checklists. Relations to other variables were supported by the URTS MCQ and checklist ability to differentiate between novice and expert experience levels and the ability to measure an effect from 30 min training of the novices. The consequences of the test were explored by a standard setting establishing a meaningful pass/fail score. The finding that a group of trained novices did not obtain a significant lower URTS checklist score to compare to a group of experts may be surprising at first. However, previous studies have shown that experts often do not adhere strictly to detailed checklists compared with trained intermediate learners [20] although they are better at providing accurate overall diagnoses. However, COVID-testing is a relatively simple procedure requiring limited and relatively elementary knowledge and skills, which may indicate a short learning curve that combined with the standardized simulated model may have resulted in some level of ceiling effects. The good effect of a short simulation-based URTS training is also comparable to other studies with similar findings [21, 22] . This indicates that URTS is a well-defined procedure where non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts if they receive focused and standardized training [23] . In this study, we assessed both OPS and NPS performance as WHO recommends combining both samples for each case to increase the diagnostic sensitivity [3] . In contrast, CDC primarily recommends a single NPS sample while other studies have questioned the OPS sensitivity [4, 24, 25] . If a single NPS specimen is used for testing purpose, the NPS checklist can just be used, and the OPS checklist can instead be omitted. The URTS assessment was developed in relation to the urgent need during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use is not limited to coronavirus diagnostic but can also be used for other upper respiratory infectious diseases. We found a high inter-rater reliability between the nurse and otolaryngologist checklist ratings, supporting the use of nurses instead of physicians for the practical testing and training of the large groups of workers involved in mass testing. Therefore, we believe the URTS MCQ-test and checklists can be used as part of training of new health-care workers at the outpatient COVID-19 testing sites and at the hospital. Further, it can also be used for training of laypersons needed in mass-testing strategies where the limitation of health workers during a pandemic will not be able to cover the test needs. The checklist was made Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 7 of 10 in an OSCE format and could also be used as a part of clinical skills assessment at medical and nursing schools. The findings of the study should be interpreted in accordance with the following limitations. The study was performed in a simulation-based setting, and we cannot know if the skills are directly transferable to how they would collect URT-specimens in an outpatient test site. However, a large body of existing literature supports the use of simulation-based assessment and training of clinical skills, and numerous studies have shown good correlations between performances in the simulated and clinical setting [26, 27] . Moreover, in a clinical setting it will not be possible for the rater to see the intraoral OPS sampling technique which we instead could visualize with a video endoscope in the simulated setting for more complete assessment of sample technique (see Figure 1) . A critical part of the NPS specimen collection is whether the swab reach the nasopharyngeal wall which require an insertion length between 8-11 cm [9] . However, the rater could not directly visualize if the swab reached the nasopharyngeal wall during the test participants performance on the NPS simulator model. Nevertheless, as the model has known realistic anatomy proportions it could be seen if the swab was inserted to high and trapped before at the midturbinates instead, see Figure 1 [9, 17] . The aim of this URTS skills assessment is to ensure URT-specimens collection performance performed with correct infection control precautions. However, the URTS-skills assessment do not cover the full infection prevention and control competencies needed for health workers within infectious diseases and it should be covered by focused training and competency assessment within this area [28] . Further, the URTS-checklist focuses on the skills assessment needed for collecting specimens for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Therefore, the NPS checklist should be combined with assessment of the on-site handling of the lateral flow immunoassay if it is used as a part of competency-based training in antigen testing [29] . The use of assessment instruments with established validity evidence is a cornerstone in the provision of competency-based URT-specimen collecting training of healthcare workers during the pandemic. However, until now the training and assessment of personnel performing URT-specimen collecting have received limited attention despite its importance for overall diagnostic accuracy of the tests used. A study found that NPS simulation training significantly can improve healthcare workers\\' confidence, but the change performance was not assessed [30] . There has been a large emphasis on comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different test types (e.g., antigen vs. molecular tests) and different sampling sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal vs. saliva), and more focus should also be on the URT-specimen collecting technique and training [31, 32] . Future research and practice must incorporate descriptions of how the sampling procedure is performed and the test personnel are assessed and trained to ensure standardization and reproducibility of test design. This also applies to self-collected URT samples which can be an effective method for mass testing in future [33, 34] . We established validity evidence supporting the use of a theoretical and practical test for upper respiratory specimens\\' collection skills based on the recommendations by the WHO. Further, the results indicate that non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts after a short and focused simulation-based training session. This is the first step to enable competency-based training of the workers in the COVID-19 test centers as well as for health-care workers performing URT samples for other infectious diseases.

There has been a large emphasis on comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different test types (e.g., antigen vs. molecular tests) and different sampling sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal vs. saliva), and more focus should also be on the URT-specimen collecting technique and training [31, 32] . Future research and practice must incorporate descriptions of how the sampling procedure is performed and the test personnel are assessed and trained to ensure standardization and reproducibility of test design. This also applies to self-collected URT samples which can be an effective method for mass testing in future [33, 34] . We established validity evidence supporting the use of a theoretical and practical test for upper respiratory specimens\\' collection skills based on the recommendations by the WHO. Further, the results indicate that non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts after a short and focused simulation-based training session.

In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in ≥ 70 yearsold) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some comorbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in smoking were related to progression and deterioration compared to an improvement and stabilization of the COVID-19 illness. 7 The presence of obesity is also emerging as a risk factor with a six-fold increase risk for severe COVID-19 illness, as well as for mechanical intubation, especially in patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease. 8 Obesity appears to be shifting the severity of COVID-19 to younger ages. 9 Finally, immunosuppression following renal transplantation, and in patients with cancer, is a risk factor for severe disease, although, not necessarily for a worst prognosis. 10 In fact, adult and children patients with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population, suggesting a protective role of a weaker immune response. 11 COVID-19 hit Mexico on February 27th, 2020 with an in imported case of a subject that traveled to Italy; while the first death was reported on March 18th. 12 Currently, the 10.2% mortality rate for COVID-19 in Mexico is one of the highest in the world. 12 However, risk factors for infection and hospitalization, are almost unknown for this country. Therefore, we aimed at investigating such risk factors from a registry of the Health Secretary of Mexico that included the total number of subjects that have been tested with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR assay) of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. 13 We have hypothesized that older aged, presence of chronic health issues including obesity, diabetes, asthma, COPD, CKD, HBP and cardiovascular disorders, as well as smoking, are risk factors for infection and hospitalization for COVID-19 in Mexico. In addition, we also wanted to determine if immunosuppression, would be a protective factor as it has been previously suggested, and to explore if the indigenous population in Mexico would be at a similar risk for COVID-19 as the rest of the population.

For place of residence, all metropolitan areas with more than 1 million inhabitants were included, and individuals from the rest of the country\\'s cities were considered the reference group. For all other variables that include a yes or no answer, the \"no\" response was considered as the reference value. The risk of infection or hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Numerical variables were described with medians and interquartile range (IQR) or means and standard deviations (SD). The significance of differences between the groups (cases and controls) was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U-test or the ttest. The association of significant variables with infection or hospitalization was explored using ULR and MLR logistic regression models. The association was expressed as the odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), and the contribution to the variability of be infected or hospitalized was expressed as adjusted r 2 .

All statistical tests were two-sided. The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A total of 102,875 registered individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, were included in the study; 31,522 (30.6%) were positive and 71,353 (69.4) had a negative result. The demographic characteristics of the cases and controls are presented in Table 1 . Positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in men than women (35.2% vs. 25 .9%, p<0.001), and increases progressively with age, from 10.6% in individuals in the ≤20 year-old group, up to 44.2% in the 61-70 year-old group (p<0.001). Interestingly, the percentage of positivity was higher in native Mexican population than in the rest of individuals (39.5% vs. 30.5%, p<0.001), and much lower in foreigners than in nationals (19.4% vs. 30.8%, p<0.001). On the other hand, positivity in the US-border cities (Tijuana and Juarez) and Cancun, about 60% of the individuals that were explored, was higher than that in Mexico City (38.6%), the State of Mexico (44.5%), and the rest of the country (25.9%). The positivity-rate in individuals with co-morbidities such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension was much higher than the one in subjects without these co-morbidities, mainly with diabetes (43% vs. 28.7%, p<0.001); and it is striking that in asthmatic or individuals with immunosuppression, as well as in smokers, the opposite was found, a lower infection rate compared to those with these factors (see Table 1 ).

Places with the highest risk were Tijuana Table 2 ). The place of residence explains 9% of the variability of the risk of infection. The age was the second most important risk factor for infection ( Table 2 ). The greatest risk starts in the group of 21-30 years-old, relative to the group of 20 years or younger, with an OR=2.31 (CI=2.13-2.51, p<0.001), and then, progressively increases as the age range rises to the age group of 61-70 yearsold, which has a 6.71 times higher risk of becoming infected than young people aged ≤20 years-old. Then, in those over 70 years-old, the risk of infection decreases slightly (OR=4.95, CI=4.53-5.41, p<0.001). Despite conferring a high risk, age only contributes 5.8% of the total variability of the risk of infection. Also, men are 1.55 times more at risk of becoming infected than women, although this factor only explains 1.4% of the risk variability. Interestingly, indigenous subjects were 1.49 times more at risk of becoming infected than the rest of the population, however, this factor contributes very little to the variability of the risk of infection (0.1%). On the other hand, foreigners and immigrants in Mexico had a lower risk of becoming infected by the SARS-CoV-2 ( (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For this analysis, the risk of being hospitalized was investigated once the subjects were positive for SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR (n=31,522). Among them, only 40.3% (n=12,690) were hospitalized. In general, the factors that contributed to the risk of infection also contributed to the risk of hospitalization, with notable exceptions and variations ( (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In the current study we have found that place of residence, followed by advanced age, suffering from diabetes, obesity, being male, having BPH, and notoriously being indigenous conferred a higher for infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma, immunosuppression or smoking are protective factors against infection, while COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, advanced age is the main factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes, HBP, being indigenous, male sex and place of residence. Unlike protecting against infection, immunosuppression and COPD, were risk factors for hospitalization, while asthma was a protective factor. The strengths of this work include the large size of the sample studied, the sampling of individuals at the national level in Mexico, and the analysis of the most important demographic data and comorbidities. However, important weaknesses are the lack of information on the outcomes of the disease and sociocultural data that may be important for the risk of infection, such as occupation, use of mass transit, attendance at mass events, and adherence to containment measures in the country. It is interesting to note that the greatest risk of infection and hospitalization is conferred by cities with much trade with the USA (Tijuana and Juarez) and the port All rights reserved.

This suggests that at these sites, at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a higher proportion of Covid-19 cases that were imported from abroad and were higher than in other regions of the country, subsequently favoring the pandemic expansion into the region. The metropolitan area, in the center of Mexico, including Mexico City and the State of Mexico, is the second most common place of residence conferring a risk of infection by SARS-Cov-2. However, while people living in Mexico City are less at risk of hospitalization, people living in the State of Mexico have 2times greater risk than those living in the rest of the country, suggesting that by the time they get the RT-PCR test, the disease is much more advanced. Because of the age distribution of cases, the Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized as an illness of adults. 14, 15 Since the initial reports, data on individuals below the age of 20 have been scarce. 16 Efforts to detect infection in children have been able to identify only a few and most of them present mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and are identified during epidemiological surveillance. 17 The age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. 18 This same study estimated that clinical symptoms occur in 25% of infected subjects within the 10-19 age group, rising to 76% in those over 70 years. 18 In Mexico, the infection distribution according to age is similar to that in China and other countries. Table 1 shows that only 2.6% of all the tests have been performed in people younger than 20, and only 10% were positive. In contrast, close to 40% of individuals older than 60 that were tested, were positive. Furthermore, the risk of becoming infected increased with age, starting from early ages ( Table 2 ).

On the other hand, the risk of hospitalization follows a well-established dose-response gradient with age, starting at 41 years of age and jumping by decade to almost double for every age group, as shown in Table   3 . This pattern has been observed in other countries as well. 20 According to sex, men are more susceptible to viral infections and worst clinical prognosis, 21 eliciting lower amounts of interferon alpha (IFN-α) in response to tolllike receptor (TLR) 7 ligands but also higher amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 after stimulation with TLR8 and TLR9 ligands or viruses. More specifically, in a large meta-analysis of Covid-19 a higher incidence in men was reported. 14 In fact, results from the randomized effects-model meta-analysis revealed a higher male incidence (i.e., 60%) of Covid-19. This proclivity in men to acquire the COVID 19 infection confirm previous accounts for MERS-COV and SARS-COV. 22, 23 Furthermore, a fatal outcome of Covid-19 infection in men, is consistently found throughout series. Present observations are in line with the notion that males are prone to COVID-19 infection, clinical deterioration and death. 22, [24] [25] [26] Notably, indigenous ethnicity emerged as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for hospitalization in this large dataset. However, the fact that indigenous ethnicity is a risk factor for relevant clinical outcomes is a finding that should be investigated in detail. 26 We have recently described indigenous ethnicity is also a risk factor for COVID-19 death. 25 It is possible that factors that limit access to healthcare may explain the emergence of this novel risk factor, such as the availability of hospital and ICU beds, dedicated healthcare personnel, medical All rights reserved.

This will be the subject of future analysis. Globally, patients with SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes or metabolic syndrome had an increased death-rate. 27, 28 Considering that the burden of diabetes in Mexico is very important increasing the general risk of mortality in at least five fold for every cause, 23 is a crucial factor that together with obesity might explain the lower age-threshold for the Covid-19 mortality found in this country (>41 years-old); in contrast with other countries reporting increased risk for mortality in those older than 60 or 65. 7 The process causing damage to kidneys and heart, 29, 30 might be more lethal in Mexican diabetics. The above may be explained by the frequent presence of uncontrolled levels of glucose and in general, without SARS-CoV-2, they are 30 times more at risk than the rest of the population, to die of kidney failure. 31 This excess risk causes a larger burden during the pandemic to the already overloaded ICU services and demands for new standards to define the best criteria to manage diabetics in Mexico. 26 In the current study, obesity was the second most important risk factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection after obesity, however it was not such an important factor for hospitalization. The higher risk for infection is in agreement with findings from China, in which obesity remained a significant risk factor even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, HBP, and dyslipidemia. 8 However, the fact that in Mexico obesity was less important than other risk factors for hospitalization, is somewhat different than other reports. 22, [32] [33] [34] [35] The connection between obesity and COVID-19 is beyond the scope of the current paper but factors such as attenuation of the immune system and chronic inflammation, have been implicated. 22 Also, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to All rights reserved.

In the presence of diabetes and conditions such as HBP, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus may easily enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. 36 Nevertheless, the higher risk for COVID-19 infection among diabetic and obese subjects in Mexico is an important factor considering that in 2017, this country was number five in population suffering from diabetes in the world, with 12.0 million subjects affected, and has one of the highest obesity prevalence-rates, 32.4% among the 15-74 year-old population-group. 37, 38 Furthermore, these findings are of great importance for implementing public health strategies for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 in this population. 9 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines state that patients with moderate to severe asthma could have a greater risk for severe illness. 27 In fact asthmatics are at risk for more severe outcomes with other virus infections. It is known that they have a delay innate anti-viral immune responses, with deficiency in lung cell interferon \\uf061, \\uf062 and \\uf067 responses related to higher asthma exacerbation severity. 28, 29, 39 Recommendations for asthmatics during the Covid-19 pandemic are to continue their asthma medication to prevent exacerbations and be lifesaving. 40 Interestingly, in our study, asthma showed a decreased risk for Covid-19 infection and hospitalization. In Covid-19, the evolution to a critical stage is associated to a cytokine storm, so it could be possible that a regular use of low dosage of corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory drugs, could prevent inflammation and decrease the risk of a critical illness. 41 In addition, COPD did not increase the risk for Covid-19 infection in Mexico, however, it increased the risk for hospitalization.

As mentioned before, clinical deterioration of has been associated to an overactive immune response, and based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently studied as potential treatments for severe Covid-19. 44 Some authors hypothesized that a moderately reduced immune response may play a favorable role in the severity of the diseases due to a lack of significant increase in IL-6. 45 One of the most intriguing issues is that smoking/nicotine theoretically should be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection since nicotine affects the ACE2 receptors. 46 However, our results suggest that smoking is a protective mechanism for Covid-19 infection. It has been published that there is an increased ACE2 expression in the airways of current smokers and those with COPD. 33, 47, 48 Studies indicate that ACE2 is likely to be the host-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, 49 but also is involved in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). 50 Most importantly, ACE2 could have a double mechanism, both protective and pathogenic roles within RAS pathways, and its direct mechanisms in cells, remains unknown. 50 It has been hypothesized that nicotine, in other health conditions, could influence the cytokine response. 51 Nicotine is usually confounded with cigarette smoking, since it is the most common mechanism to access the drug. Therefore, public health specialists ought to consider it as a negative risk factor, since smoking is a health hazard. 52 However, empirical data shows otherwise; nicotine regardless of the pathway utilized to deliver it, may be a protector for the general population, 53 including for Covid-19 infection.

The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are || Título: OR=4.91, CI=4.48-5.38, p<0.001), Cancun (OR=4.3, CI=3.84-4.81, p<0.001) and Juarez (OR=3.86, CI=3,31-4,5, p<0.001), followed by the metropolitan area of the State of Mexico (OR=2.3, CI=2.21-2.39, p<0.001) and Mexico City (OR=1.8, CI=1.74-1.86, p<0.001). Notoriously, people living in Monterrey and Guadalajara have a 3.5 to 3.9 times lower risk of becoming infected than those living in the rest of the country ( || Título: p<0.001) were at higher risk of infection than those without it. Among them, diabetes contributed the most to the variability of the risk of infection (1.5%), and the three factors together contribute only 3.3%. It is interesting to note that patients with asthma (OR=0.63, IC=0.59-0.68, p<0.001) or immunosuppression (OR=0.65, IC=0.59-0.72, p<0.001), as well as smokers (OR=0.85, IC=0.82-0.89, p<0.001), had a lower risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, COPD did not contribute to the risk of infection, and cardiovascular diseases other than HBP, very marginally decreased it, while CKD increased the risk of infection. In the multivariate analysis, in which variables with a p≤0.2 in the URL models were entered, all variables but three (immigrant, HBP, CKD) remained in the model. Very noticeable, all the variables that together contributed to the risk of infection, only explained 18.4% of the variability of the risk of infection. This suggests that sociocultural variables, not included in the analysis, such as occupation, means of transportation, and compliance with containment measures could be much more important than the factors analyzed in this work to explain the risk of infection. || Título: other hand, factors that protected against infection, like immunosuppression (OR=2.69, CI=2.26-3.2, p<0.001) or other cardiovascular diseases (OR=2.45, CI=2.14-2.81, p<0.001), or that do not contribute to the risk of infection, such as COPD (OR=3.63, CI=3.1-4.24, p<0.001) and CKD (OR=4.24, CI=3.61-4.97, p<0.001), conferred a very high risk for hospitalization. Notoriously, being asthmatic not only protected against infection but also against being hospitalized (OR=0.7, CI=0.61-0.8, p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis all factors remained in the model, except being an immigrant, other cardiovascular diseases, and smoking. The latter conferred a marginal risk for hospitalization in the ULR model. The overall r 2 value obtained in the MLR model was 0.277, indicating that there are other factors All rights reserved.

Notably, indigenous ethnicity emerged as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for hospitalization in this large dataset. In addition, having immunosuppression, smoking and asthma are protective factors against infection, and the latter one also protects against hospitalization. These findings are important for establishing public health policies and allocate healthcare resources during this pandemic. 53. Russo P, Bonassi S, Giacconi R, et al. COVID-19 and Smoking. Is Nicotine the Hidden Link? Eur Respir J 2020. || Título: Design, study population and setting. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects).13 This registry collects demographic and clinical information from the 475 Respiratory Disease Monitoring Units (USMER) of the Viral Respiratory Disease Epidemiological Surveillance System, located in health centers or hospitals throughout the country and includes all national health systems (IMSS, ISSSTE, SS, SEDENA, SEMAR, others). The information contained in that database corresponds only to the data obtained from the epidemiological study of suspected viral respiratory disease at the time the person is interrogated in those medical units. According to the clinical diagnosis of admission, it was considered whether the patient could be managed ambulatorily or had to be hospitalized. However, the database does not include clinical symptomatology or evolution during the stay in the medical units. || Título: Main outcome measures. Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, HBP, asthma, immunosuppression, COPD, cardiovascular disease other than HBP, CKD, and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. Speaking indigenous languages/dialects was used as a surrogate marker of indigenous Mexican population. || Título: All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. || Título: . For example, the risk of hospitalization conferred by age, began in the 41-50 years-old group (OR=2.98, CI=2.47-3.59, p<0.001), considering the MLR analysis, and rapidly increased to the >70 years (OR=11.6, CI=9.48-14.19, All rights reserved.

Unlike the risk of infection, for hospitalization, age contributed much more than the city of residence (18% vs. 4.8%). In fact, age is the main contributing factor for being hospitalized. Living in Juarez confers the highest risk of being hospitalized (OR=4.22, CI=3.38-5.26, p<0.001), followed by the State of Mexico (OR=1.95, CI=1.83-2.08, p<0.001) and Cancun (OR=1.77, CI=1.53-2.04, p<0.001). In contrast, living in Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara, confer lower risk for hospitalization than living in the rest of the country. Positive individuals for SARS-CoV-2 who speak an indigenous language are almost twice as likely to be hospitalized (OR=1.89, IC=1.57-2.28, p<0.001), suggesting that they consult at a more severe disease stage. Diabetes (OR=3.69, CI=3.48-3.92, p<0.001), contributes more than HBP (OR=2.79, CI=2.64-2.95, p<0.001), and HBP, more than obesity (OR=1.47, CI=1.39-1.55, p<0.001) on the risk of being || Título: The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20104414 doi: medRxiv preprint || Título: Demographic and clinical characteristic of studied population (n=102,875) * HBP= High blood pressure, COPD= chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CKD= chronic kidney disease *The percentage was calculated by the totals of each line a. p>0.05, b. p<0.05, c. p<0.01, d. p<0.001, e. p<0.001, f. p<0.0001 || Título: The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 26, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20104414 doi: medRxiv preprint || Título: Risk of infection with the virus SARS-Cov-2 in MexicoAll rights reserved.

              " 'body_text': [\"In the space of a few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way neurology is practiced around the world. In order to control the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended isolation of sick persons, quarantine for those who may been exposed to the virus and social distancing. [1] Social distancing also referred to as physical distancing meant keeping space between people outside of their homes. A distance of at least 6 feet was recommended and people were asked not to gather in large groups, avoid crowded places and mass gatherings. [2] On March 24 th , 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world's largest lockdown asking 1.3 billion Indians to stay home for 21 days to slow the spread of COVID-19. [3] The lockdown has now been extended till May 3 rd . [4] All international and national flights were suspended, as were the train and vehicular services in the cities and across state lines. In New Delhi, hospitals canceled all elective surgeries, closed in-patient epilepsy and stroke units and canceled all outpatient clinics. Patients were discharged from the hospitals. Beds especially ICU beds and other resources such as ventilators were reserved for COVID-19 patients. Physicians working in these hospitals were advised to adopt telemedicine in order to primarily maintain the continuity of care for their existing patients. A developing country like India did not have existing infrastructure to support telemedicine. Most physician neurologists in India do not have electronic health record (EHR) software. After seeing the patient, the neurologist documents the history, clinical findings, assessment and plan including prescriptions on paper (letterhead), which is then handed over to the patient. Most neurologists do not maintain copies of this letterhead for their own records. When the patient comes for a follow-up visit, he brings the original letterhead with him to maintain continuity of care. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic some hospitals in India tried to roll out vendor-supported platforms through which telemedicine could be practiced. India has the largest population of illiterate adults and many patients experienced difficulty in downloading the software and logging on to the patient portal. India leads the world in accessing the Internet by mobile phones and for the people in semi-urban and rural India, mobile phones are an easy and more economical way to stay connected than devices like laptops. India's mobile (cellular) subscriber base has reached 1,176 million in 2018. [5] WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum. [6] On February 19 th , 2014, Facebook, Inc. acquired WhatsApp. [7] Most Indians are quite savvy in use of mobiles phones and WhatsApp. It is estimated that there are more than 400 million WhatsApp users in India. The first author utilized WhatsApp as the portal to provide continuity of care to his existing neurology patients and to see new patients. Before the appointment, patients were requested to send their medical records (including prior letterhead) and neuroimaging records. The first author then would call the patient at the predetermined time on WhatsApp and use either audio-call or video-call feature to discuss the case and treatment plan. He was successful in using WhatsApp to administer and guide care during neurological emergencies such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, status epilepticus, altered mental status, transient loss of consciousness, concussion and traumatic brain injury. A patient with a large subdural hematoma with significant midline shift and subfalcine herniation was advised emergency decompressive surgery. Another patient's family with a large brainstem hemorrhage was advised against transfer to the author's hospital and to continue current care at the regional hospital. The author realized the limitations of teleneurology when he consulted on a 39-year woman with complaint of numbness of both legs for the past 3 days. Numbness had rapidly increased over 3 days to the point that she was barely able to walk. No bladder or bowel symptoms were reported. Three months ago, she had complaint of pain back of the neck and both shoulders without radiation into the arms. She had been evaluated in a regional government hospital and prescribed pregabalin. On tele-video visit, her gait was not spastic, legs in fact seemed frail. Lying down, she could barely lift her legs off the bed and was unable to hold them against gravity. The author was able to look for a sensory level by asking the patient's relative to do the sensory testing examination but was significantly hampered by inability to test for deep tendon reflexes. The patient was advised to go to the hospital for an MRI spine, nerve conduction study and a formal neurological consultation but the family declined citing fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Differential diagnoses included demyelinating neuropathy as well demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The author decided to prescribe a course of oral methylprednisolone along with Vitamin B12 supplementation. On follow-up tele-neurology consultation 7 days later, the patient reported she was better and able to walk with assistance. She was advised to follow up in person after the lockdown was over. Patients paid for the consultation through Paytm, a popular and widely used Indian e-commerce platform available in 11 Indian languages. [8] WhatsApp end-to-end encryption ensures that only you and the person you are communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. India's population is around 1.3 billion and registered trained neurologist are around 1500. The burden of neurological diseases is huge and unmet by the small number of neurologists. In a low to middle income country like India, the author found WhatsApp as the best platform to offer teleneurology services to his patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this application offers tremendous opportunities when it comes to administering neurology services, daunting challenges related to patient confidentiality, keeping patients medical information and health records secure and limitations of teleneurology in a clinical examination heavy specialty such as neurology need to be overcome to truly unleash the full potential of WhatsApp neurology.

Patients paid for the consultation through Paytm, a popular and widely used Indian e-commerce platform available in 11 Indian languages. [8] WhatsApp end-to-end encryption ensures that only you and the person you are communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. India's population is around 1.3 billion and registered trained neurologist are around 1500. The burden of neurological diseases is huge and unmet by the small number of neurologists. In a low to middle income country like India, the author found WhatsApp as the best platform to offer teleneurology services to his patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this application offers tremendous opportunities when it comes to administering neurology services, daunting challenges related to patient confidentiality, keeping patients medical information and health records secure and limitations of teleneurology in a clinical examination heavy specialty such as neurology need to be overcome to truly unleash the full potential of WhatsApp neurology.

            "{'title': 'Lessons learned about virtual cancer care and distress screening in the time of COVID-19', 'abstract': 'Purpose Cancer-related biopsychosocial distress is highly prevalent across the cancer care continuum. The implementation of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19 is the significant decrease in screening patients for biopsychosocial symptom burden. Methods Given that screening for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre. Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In this paper, we present pre-and post-COVID data on the frequency of distress screening and its impact on patient care. Results A review of pre-and post-COVID-19 screening for distress questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and received less resources and referrals to supportive care. Conclusion The rapid integration of virtual care without the inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person clinic patients) received different levels of care and interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals. Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support distress screening and best patient-centric care.', 'body_text': 'In the care of cancer patients, psychosocial oncology has been incorporated as a standard in most cancer care organizations. No longer can we think only about cure; importantly, cancer care must also strive to support cancer patients through diagnosis, treatment, palliation and living with cancer and its side effects and symptoms. Along with the growth and development of psychosocial oncology and supportive care programs, biopsychosocial screening for distress has become globally endorsed as a standard of practice in most cancer care programs. With the onset of COVID-19, cancer care, including psychosocial and supportive care delivery, has shifted from inperson to virtual care. In this paper, we will examine how screening for biopsychosocial distress has been impacted by the shift to virtual care [1, 2] . Biopsychosocial screening for distress (sixth vital sign) was first proposed in 2005 [3] and has been widely endorsed globally as a standard of quality cancer care [4] . The importance of distress screening is now widely seen as an accreditation standard in many countries, societies and cancer care organizations [5] . Research has demonstrated that distress screening alone is not an intervention but rather a prompt for patients to respond to key concerns raised on a standardized questionnaire and requires the healthcare team to acknowledge and address these symptoms and concerns in the clinical encounter with the patient. A standardized multifactorial screening for distress tool can specify key physical and psychosocial concerns and, if followed-up by the clinical team, can serve to facilitate a discussion between patient and care provider. These patientcentric conversations between patients and their care team allow for shared decision-making regarding which strategies may be best suited to manage/mitigate the patient\\'s symptoms and/or concerns [6] . The use of a standardized questionnaire adds specificity to the most distressing concerns and can replace the broad salutation of \"how are you doing\" leading to a much more meaningful conversation, assessment and treatment plan. In Canada, and specifically in the province of Alberta, every cancer patient is provided the opportunity to complete a screening for distress questionnaire, now called the Putting Patients First (PPF) form. Cancer Care Alberta (CCA) has a standard operating procedure that outlines the expectation for routine and repeated distress screening for all ambulatory cancer patients at key times across their care trajectory, including at first consult, once per treatment cycle and at follow-up appointments [7] . This information collected from patients on the PPF is referred to as patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In Alberta, the decision to integrate distress screening and PROs as part of routine clinical care was based on an accreditation standard for ambulatory cancer agencies in Canada [8] . The PPF includes two measures, the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESASr) [9, 10] and the Canadian Problem Checklist (CPC) [11] , selected in alignment with the national reporting criteria established by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) [12] . Province-wide implementation for all cancer patients started in 2012 with the PPF being used at all 17 ambulatory cancer facilities within Alberta [13] . Implementation strategies included workflows and targeted practice change support to ensure that each PPF questionnaire was administered and reviewed within the clinical encounter and that a shared decision-making process was enacted with the patient to identify the most meaningful clinical response to the patient\\'s priority concerns [11, 14] . In 2015, with the PPF being used in routine practice provincially, work began to capture patient responses to the screening questions digitally within CCA\\'s provincial electronic medical record (EMR), as clinicians identified several shortfalls to the paper based screening process: (1) its inability to draw attention to worsening symptoms or clusters of symptoms that amplify symptom burden [15] and (2) duplication of work in clinical documentation. As a result, a hybrid approach was designed to transfer distress screening data into the EMR, where the patient would complete a paper PPF in the waiting room, and after clinical review, a clinician would enter the PRO data along with their clinical intervention notes into the EMR. This allowed for streamlined documentation and access to digital PRO data. Once the data entry was integrated into practice, four different PRO dashboards were developed to aid in clinical care and program planning and reported PRO data at the individual (micro), clinic or institution (meso) and the provincial program (macro) levels [16] . Importantly, CCA is now able to categorize and account for overall PPF distress screening completion rates along with overall patient symptom burden and referrals for any given patient or population. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, Canada (March 2020), over 53,000 unique cancer patients had completed at least one PPF, with over 227,000 screens entered into the EMR. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and called for countries to take a whole-of-government, wholeof-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact [17] . By March 15, 2020, there were numerous in-person clinic closures and cancellations of medical procedures across the province of Alberta. Alberta Health Services (AHS) facilities were allowed to remain open, but CCA immediately went into emergency contingency planning so that, wherever appropriate, cancer patients could receive their care virtually instead of in-person at the province\\'s tertiary and community cancer centres. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, almost all ambulatory cancer care appointments took place in-person, and the province\\'s cancer patient distress screening completion rate was sitting at about 75%. Following COVID-19 being declared a pandemic, where possible, outpatient appointments were conducted virtually. On average since the pandemic started, over 79,861 (36%) outpatient appointments in CCA have occurred virtually (Fig. 1) , with 98% of virtual appointments occurring via telephone due to limitations of our existing electronic platforms. Further, the clinical process during most virtual visits is different from the approach for in-person visits, as the oncologist/nurse practitioner often conducts the virtual visit independent of the interdisciplinary clinical team who otherwise would have been involved in the clinical care. As distress screening is an organizational requirement, a workflow was proposed in order to gather PRO data from patients via telephone assessments prior to each virtual visit but was deemed too labour-intensive at most clinical sites. This has resulted in an imbalance in PPF completion rates with in-person completion rates remaining around 70%, but virtual visit PPF completion rates falling to 15% as the historical workflow depended on in-person completion in the waiting room (see Figs. 1 and 2 ). In an effort to quickly understand the impact of declining PPF completion rates in virtual visits, administrative data for all of CCA was reviewed for the first 3 months of the pandemic (April to June 2020), revealing a marked difference (ratio of 5 to 1) in the supportive care referral rates between patients seen in-person and those seen virtually (Figs. 3 and 4) . Based on these early numbers and concern regarding the drop in both PPF completion rates and supportive care referrals, CCA embarked on a robust patient experience evaluation, surveying over 400 patients to assess their experience with receiving virtual care. This evaluation revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support, receiving resources and referrals and the involvement of family and friends in their care [18] , showing a strong consistency between the administrative and patient experience data sets. The rapid integration of virtual care, often delivered by a single clinician, without the aid of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups of patients received different interventions concurrently. The data shared here points to several key learnings. (1) Using a standardized approach for symptom and distress screening in a virtual visit is just as important, if not more important as it is in an in-person encounter, as clinicians have even fewer non-verbal queues available to them in a virtual encounter [19] . They cannot see the distress the patient may be experiencing due to unmanaged or escalating symptoms, such as a change in gait, a look of fear, anxiety or depression. (2) Without the inclusion of this patient-reported symptom/distress assessment, the clinical conversation is less likely to result in a referral to a supportive care service [20] . (3) An interdisciplinary approach 36% 64% Virtual In person  to care may in fact increase the likelihood that a patient may receive supportive care referral [21] . In CCA, registered nurses are the professional group that is primarily responsible for the initial review of the PPF. They use it as a communication tool to initiate a dialogue with the patient about their symptoms and concerns and to identify potential symptom management and supportive care actions. If the actions required are outside of the registered nurses\\' scope of practice, they then engage with the most appropriate provider on the team who can manage the issue. For example, a referral to the complex pain clinic would be completed by the physician/nurse practitioner. (4) A digital workflow for collection of the PPF/distress screening tool is required, as collecting this information over the phone is still too labour-intensive in most situations [22] . Since screening for distress (sixth vital sign) has become an accreditation standard, the integration of routinely collecting distress screening, associated with clinical review, has increasingly become a clinical standard in cancer care programs in Canada. In our provincial cancer program, despite significant progress with the provincial PRO initiative and integrating the PPF into routine workflows, COVID-19 and the move to providing much of cancer care virtually have led to significantly fewer patients being screened for distress, which has resulted in less supportive care referrals. The argument can be made that these referrals are now more important than ever before as the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the emotional well-being of entire populations, let alone cancer patients [23] . It is clear that COVID-19 has provided an important teachable moment. In this natural experiment, we witnessed the negative impact of removing a standardized process to identify, assess and manage distress from ambulatory oncology clinic workflows, which has emphasized the essential link between distress screening and the connection to supportive care referrals. As Churchill said, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\". We must now find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support the best patientcentric care. Digital strategies that allow patients to complete their distress screening from home are also now required. We can no longer rely on in-person workflows. All patients must be screened for distress, and clinical conversations around symptom and distress management must continue to occur regardless of whether it is in-person or virtually.

The implementation of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19 is the significant decrease in screening patients for biopsychosocial symptom burden. Methods Given that screening for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre. Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In this paper, we present pre-and post-COVID data on the frequency of distress screening and its impact on patient care. Results A review of pre-and post-COVID-19 screening for distress questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and received less resources and referrals to supportive care. Conclusion The rapid integration of virtual care without the inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person clinic patients) received different levels of care and interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals. Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support distress screening and best patient-centric care.', 'label': 1, 'input_ids': [101, 8497, 3560, 1164, 8496,

              " 'body_text': ['Testing for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an essential part of the pandemic control [1] . Millions of individuals are tested daily as a part of mass testing strategies to identify and isolate asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in society [2] . For initial SARS-CoV-2 infections, an upper respiratory tract specimen is recommended to be collected for molecular or antigen testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends performing oropharyngeal (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) to ensure the collection of representative upper respiratory tract specimens for COVID-19 testing [3] . Proper specimen collection is considered the most important step in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 and suboptimal technique may lead to false-negative test results [4] . The test procedures can be technically difficult to perform, and due to the significant and unmet need for healthcare workers at the many community-based COVID-19 test sites, non-healthcare workers may also be used to collect upper respiratory tract specimens [5, 6] . Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the test administrators have the necessary skills to collect high-quality clinical specimens, and competency-based training should provide the skills needed. A pre-requisite for competency-based training is an assessment tool with established validity evidence for evaluating upper respiratory specimen sampling techniques at the COVID-19 test sites. This study aims to develop and examine the validity of theoretical and practical skills tests for obtaining nasopharyngeal (NPS) and oropharyngeal (OPS) specimen collection for COVID-19 testing. We conducted an experimental study to assess skills in obtaining NPS and OPS using Messick\\'s validity framework, which complies with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing guidelines [7] . A multiple-choice test (MCQ) and checklists following the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to assess NPS and OPS performance were constructed, and experts and novices were invited to participate in a validation study. Psychometric data from the study were used to explore five sources of validity evidence according to Messick\\'s validity framework: content evidence, response process, internal structure, relationships with other variables, and test consequences. A MCQ and a checklist for upper respiratory tract specimens\\' collection skills (URTS) were developed as an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format test with content evidence obtained through two steps. First, we used the technical guide from the WHO together with an additional literature review to ensure the contents of the URTS MCQ, and the URTS checklist followed international recommendations [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . We then recruited a multidisciplinary board of experts constituted by a consultant in rhinology (CvB), a consultant in head and neck surgery (JM), a consultant in infectious disease (TB), a microbiology specialist (NK), and a medical education scientist (MT) to review the content of each item on the checklist. The items were revised and re-evaluated until consensus was reached among the expert panel. Participants without any formal healthcare education were recruited to participate in the study as novices representing the competence level of general staff that could be hired in public-based COVID-19 sites for mass-testing. Their performances were assessed in a simulated setting before receiving OPS and NPS training and again afterward to measure the effect of the training session. We invited consultants and registrars (PGY-2 or more) in otolaryngology to participate in the study as the expert group. These were chosen as experts due to their anatomical knowledge and experience with procedures within the upper respiratory tract. The theoretical test was constructed as MCQ questions with three possible answers, with only one answer being correct. Some of the questions also included pictures or Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 3 of 10 anatomical animations. Printed papers with the MCQ questions were provided to all the participants who were not allowed to use handbooks, access web resources, or ask for help during the MCQ test. Each correct answer gave one point, whereas incorrect answers gave zero points. The practical test with OPS and NPS sampling techniques was conducted using a simulation-based context. A checklist was developed for the OPS and NPS sample assessing the different sub-elements of the procedures performed correctly (one point) or incorrectly (zero points). The oropharyngeal sampling was performed on a life-sized airway demonstration model (Airsim Advance Crico, Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) with a flexible endoscope (aScope 4 RhinoLaryngo, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to visualize the oropharyngeal swab technique on a video monitor (aView, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) during the procedure (see Figure 1 ). The NPS was performed on a 3D-printed simulator based on real CT scans with correct anatomic landmarks [17] . The 3D simulator model was slightly modified for the project as we added ears on the simulator head, which is important guidance for the nasopharyngeal sample (see Figure 1 ).

The novices then observed a video from WHO demonstrating the technique on a real person [18] . The training session ended with hands-on practice of OPS and NPS on the simulation models described previously with feedback from the teacher. A post-training assessment was conducted with a theoretical MCQ test followed by an assessment of OPS and NPS performance on the simulators without any guidance from the teacher. The novices answered the MCQ test and performed OPS and NPS on the simulators before (pretest) and again after training (posttest). The expert group also answered the MCQ and performed OPS and NPS on the same simulators, and all performances were Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 4 of 10 video recorded for subsequent assessment with the URTS checklist. A nurse (RCE) and resident in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (LH) rated all the videos independently. Prior to the rating, a 30-min rater training session was conducted. They watched four pilot videos (not being a part of the assessment videos used in the study) and discussed any disagreement in their URTS checklist ratings. Then, the two raters assessed all the videos using the URTS checklist in a randomized order and blinded to who had received training. To evaluate internal structure of the constructed MCQ, item statistics including item difficulty index and item discriminatory index were calculated. MCQs with appropriate testing properties were selected to be included in the test and internal consistency reliability was calculated as Cronbach\\'s alpha. Inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute agreement definition, was used for measuring inter-rater reliability, and Cronbach\\'s alpha was used to evaluate the internal structure of the final items on checklists. The \"relations to other variables\" validity evidence were explored by comparing the MCQ and checklist scores between groups. The test scores discriminatory abilities between experts and untrained/trained novices were explored with independent samples t-tests and the effect of the training was determined using a paired samples t-test. The contrasting groups\\' method [19] was used to explore the \"test consequences\" and establish the pass/fail levels of both tests to determine who is ready for independent practice. We examined the consequences of these criteria for both tests using the postcourse test scores to determine the proportion of newly trained non-healthcare professionals having completed the combined theoretical and hands-on course that passed and failed the tests, respectively. All the statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package (PASW, version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and two-sided significance levels of 0.05 were used for all analyses. Twenty-four novices without any healthcare education agreed to participate in the study and 16 experts who were registrars or consultants in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery working either at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Zealand University Hospital, Køge or Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. All 24 novices were both pre-and post-tested while the 16 experts only were tested once. In total, results from 64 URTS MCQ tests and 128 videos of OPS and NPS performance were available for assessment with the URTS checklist. The URTS MCQ and the URTS checklist items were based on the WHO recommendations and revised based on content matter expert reviews. Based on the comments by the expert review, nine of the fourteen MCQ questions were revised, and one new item was added. Item analysis showed that 12 out of 15 items had acceptable item discriminatory indices of 0.18 or above, whereas the remaining three had indices below 0.04 and were removed from the final test. Five of the 17 URTS checklist items for OPS and NPS performance were revised to the final version approved by all the experts and used for the study (see Appendix A). All MCQ tests were administered in a standardized fashion without allowing the participants any guidance. After completing a half-hour rater training, the raters were able to conduct assessments using both OPS and NPS checklists without any missing values. The two raters reported no difficulty in performing ratings in the simulated context despite dissimilarities between the simulated and clinical procedure (e.g., no head movements during insertion of swabs or interaction with the patient). The internal consistency reliability of the MCQ test was 0.76. The URTS checklist score demonstrated good inter-rater reliability for OPS and NPS skills assessment of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. Internal consistency reliabilities for both instruments were high, Cronbach\\'s alpha 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. The URTS MCQ-test score was significant higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The novices scored higher after training (p < 0.001) but still significantly lower than the experts (p = 0.008).  This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. The URTS checklist score was significantly higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 for both OPS and NPS (see Table 1 ). The novices scored higher after both NPS and OPS training (p < 0.001) but not significantly lower than the experts when the OPS score (p = 0.14) and the NPS score (p = 0.49) were compared (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The contrasting groups\\' method established an MCQ-test pass/fail score of 91% and a checklist pass/fail score of the 76% for OPS and 61% for NPS, see Figure 2 . The consequences of the standard setting were that thirteen of the trained novices failed MCQtest while only one failed the competency-based assessment with the URTS checklist (see Figure 2 and Table 1 ). This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. Sources of validity evidence were explored in this study following Messick\\'s validity framework. The content of the checklist was based on literature review and multi-speciality expert consensus. The response process was ensured by controlled testing environments, rater training, and the anatomical correct simulators used in the testing setup. A high inter-rater and inter-item reliability supported the internal structure validity evidence for both the MCQ-test and checklists. Relations to other variables were supported by the URTS MCQ and checklist ability to differentiate between novice and expert experience levels and the ability to measure an effect from 30 min training of the novices. The consequences of the test were explored by a standard setting establishing a meaningful pass/fail score. The finding that a group of trained novices did not obtain a significant lower URTS checklist score to compare to a group of experts may be surprising at first. However, previous studies have shown that experts often do not adhere strictly to detailed checklists compared with trained intermediate learners [20] although they are better at providing accurate overall diagnoses. However, COVID-testing is a relatively simple procedure requiring limited and relatively elementary knowledge and skills, which may indicate a short learning curve that combined with the standardized simulated model may have resulted in some level of ceiling effects. The good effect of a short simulation-based URTS training is also comparable to other studies with similar findings [21, 22] . This indicates that URTS is a well-defined procedure where non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts if they receive focused and standardized training [23] . In this study, we assessed both OPS and NPS performance as WHO recommends combining both samples for each case to increase the diagnostic sensitivity [3] . In contrast, CDC primarily recommends a single NPS sample while other studies have questioned the OPS sensitivity [4, 24, 25] . If a single NPS specimen is used for testing purpose, the NPS checklist can just be used, and the OPS checklist can instead be omitted. The URTS assessment was developed in relation to the urgent need during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use is not limited to coronavirus diagnostic but can also be used for other upper respiratory infectious diseases. We found a high inter-rater reliability between the nurse and otolaryngologist checklist ratings, supporting the use of nurses instead of physicians for the practical testing and training of the large groups of workers involved in mass testing. Therefore, we believe the URTS MCQ-test and checklists can be used as part of training of new health-care workers at the outpatient COVID-19 testing sites and at the hospital. Further, it can also be used for training of laypersons needed in mass-testing strategies where the limitation of health workers during a pandemic will not be able to cover the test needs. The checklist was made Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 7 of 10 in an OSCE format and could also be used as a part of clinical skills assessment at medical and nursing schools. The findings of the study should be interpreted in accordance with the following limitations. The study was performed in a simulation-based setting, and we cannot know if the skills are directly transferable to how they would collect URT-specimens in an outpatient test site. However, a large body of existing literature supports the use of simulation-based assessment and training of clinical skills, and numerous studies have shown good correlations between performances in the simulated and clinical setting [26, 27] . Moreover, in a clinical setting it will not be possible for the rater to see the intraoral OPS sampling technique which we instead could visualize with a video endoscope in the simulated setting for more complete assessment of sample technique (see Figure 1) . A critical part of the NPS specimen collection is whether the swab reach the nasopharyngeal wall which require an insertion length between 8-11 cm [9] . However, the rater could not directly visualize if the swab reached the nasopharyngeal wall during the test participants performance on the NPS simulator model. Nevertheless, as the model has known realistic anatomy proportions it could be seen if the swab was inserted to high and trapped before at the midturbinates instead, see Figure 1 [9, 17] . The aim of this URTS skills assessment is to ensure URT-specimens collection performance performed with correct infection control precautions. However, the URTS-skills assessment do not cover the full infection prevention and control competencies needed for health workers within infectious diseases and it should be covered by focused training and competency assessment within this area [28] . Further, the URTS-checklist focuses on the skills assessment needed for collecting specimens for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Therefore, the NPS checklist should be combined with assessment of the on-site handling of the lateral flow immunoassay if it is used as a part of competency-based training in antigen testing [29] . The use of assessment instruments with established validity evidence is a cornerstone in the provision of competency-based URT-specimen collecting training of healthcare workers during the pandemic. However, until now the training and assessment of personnel performing URT-specimen collecting have received limited attention despite its importance for overall diagnostic accuracy of the tests used. A study found that NPS simulation training significantly can improve healthcare workers\\' confidence, but the change performance was not assessed [30] . There has been a large emphasis on comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different test types (e.g., antigen vs. molecular tests) and different sampling sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal vs. saliva), and more focus should also be on the URT-specimen collecting technique and training [31, 32] . Future research and practice must incorporate descriptions of how the sampling procedure is performed and the test personnel are assessed and trained to ensure standardization and reproducibility of test design. This also applies to self-collected URT samples which can be an effective method for mass testing in future [33, 34] . We established validity evidence supporting the use of a theoretical and practical test for upper respiratory specimens\\' collection skills based on the recommendations by the WHO. Further, the results indicate that non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts after a short and focused simulation-based training session. This is the first step to enable competency-based training of the workers in the COVID-19 test centers as well as for health-care workers performing URT samples for other infectious diseases.

              " 'body_text': ['Testing for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an essential part of the pandemic control [1] . Millions of individuals are tested daily as a part of mass testing strategies to identify and isolate asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in society [2] . For initial SARS-CoV-2 infections, an upper respiratory tract specimen is recommended to be collected for molecular or antigen testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends performing oropharyngeal (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) to ensure the collection of representative upper respiratory tract specimens for COVID-19 testing [3] . Proper specimen collection is considered the most important step in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 and suboptimal technique may lead to false-negative test results [4] . The test procedures can be technically difficult to perform, and due to the significant and unmet need for healthcare workers at the many community-based COVID-19 test sites, non-healthcare workers may also be used to collect upper respiratory tract specimens [5, 6] . Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the test administrators have the necessary skills to collect high-quality clinical specimens, and competency-based training should provide the skills needed. A pre-requisite for competency-based training is an assessment tool with established validity evidence for evaluating upper respiratory specimen sampling techniques at the COVID-19 test sites. This study aims to develop and examine the validity of theoretical and practical skills tests for obtaining nasopharyngeal (NPS) and oropharyngeal (OPS) specimen collection for COVID-19 testing. We conducted an experimental study to assess skills in obtaining NPS and OPS using Messick\\'s validity framework, which complies with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing guidelines [7] . A multiple-choice test (MCQ) and checklists following the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to assess NPS and OPS performance were constructed, and experts and novices were invited to participate in a validation study. Psychometric data from the study were used to explore five sources of validity evidence according to Messick\\'s validity framework: content evidence, response process, internal structure, relationships with other variables, and test consequences. A MCQ and a checklist for upper respiratory tract specimens\\' collection skills (URTS) were developed as an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) format test with content evidence obtained through two steps. First, we used the technical guide from the WHO together with an additional literature review to ensure the contents of the URTS MCQ, and the URTS checklist followed international recommendations [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . We then recruited a multidisciplinary board of experts constituted by a consultant in rhinology (CvB), a consultant in head and neck surgery (JM), a consultant in infectious disease (TB), a microbiology specialist (NK), and a medical education scientist (MT) to review the content of each item on the checklist. The items were revised and re-evaluated until consensus was reached among the expert panel. Participants without any formal healthcare education were recruited to participate in the study as novices representing the competence level of general staff that could be hired in public-based COVID-19 sites for mass-testing. Their performances were assessed in a simulated setting before receiving OPS and NPS training and again afterward to measure the effect of the training session. We invited consultants and registrars (PGY-2 or more) in otolaryngology to participate in the study as the expert group. These were chosen as experts due to their anatomical knowledge and experience with procedures within the upper respiratory tract. The theoretical test was constructed as MCQ questions with three possible answers, with only one answer being correct. Some of the questions also included pictures or Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 3 of 10 anatomical animations. Printed papers with the MCQ questions were provided to all the participants who were not allowed to use handbooks, access web resources, or ask for help during the MCQ test. Each correct answer gave one point, whereas incorrect answers gave zero points. The practical test with OPS and NPS sampling techniques was conducted using a simulation-based context. A checklist was developed for the OPS and NPS sample assessing the different sub-elements of the procedures performed correctly (one point) or incorrectly (zero points). The oropharyngeal sampling was performed on a life-sized airway demonstration model (Airsim Advance Crico, Trucorp, Belfast, Northern Ireland) with a flexible endoscope (aScope 4 RhinoLaryngo, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) attached to visualize the oropharyngeal swab technique on a video monitor (aView, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) during the procedure (see Figure 1 ). The NPS was performed on a 3D-printed simulator based on real CT scans with correct anatomic landmarks [17] . The 3D simulator model was slightly modified for the project as we added ears on the simulator head, which is important guidance for the nasopharyngeal sample (see Figure 1 ). The URTS teaching material, checklists and the 3D printed model is made freely available on the following website: http://www.urt-sample.com (accessed on 25 October 2021).

A power-point presentation demonstrated upper-airway anatomy and the steps in the techniques for performing OPS and NPS. The novices then observed a video from WHO demonstrating the technique on a real person [18] . The training session ended with hands-on practice of OPS and NPS on the simulation models described previously with feedback from the teacher. A post-training assessment was conducted with a theoretical MCQ test followed by an assessment of OPS and NPS performance on the simulators without any guidance from the teacher. The novices answered the MCQ test and performed OPS and NPS on the simulators before (pretest) and again after training (posttest). The expert group also answered the MCQ and performed OPS and NPS on the same simulators, and all performances were Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 4 of 10 video recorded for subsequent assessment with the URTS checklist. A nurse (RCE) and resident in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (LH) rated all the videos independently. Prior to the rating, a 30-min rater training session was conducted. They watched four pilot videos (not being a part of the assessment videos used in the study) and discussed any disagreement in their URTS checklist ratings. Then, the two raters assessed all the videos using the URTS checklist in a randomized order and blinded to who had received training. To evaluate internal structure of the constructed MCQ, item statistics including item difficulty index and item discriminatory index were calculated. MCQs with appropriate testing properties were selected to be included in the test and internal consistency reliability was calculated as Cronbach\\'s alpha. Inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients, absolute agreement definition, was used for measuring inter-rater reliability, and Cronbach\\'s alpha was used to evaluate the internal structure of the final items on checklists. The \"relations to other variables\" validity evidence were explored by comparing the MCQ and checklist scores between groups. The test scores discriminatory abilities between experts and untrained/trained novices were explored with independent samples t-tests and the effect of the training was determined using a paired samples t-test. The contrasting groups\\' method [19] was used to explore the \"test consequences\" and establish the pass/fail levels of both tests to determine who is ready for independent practice. We examined the consequences of these criteria for both tests using the postcourse test scores to determine the proportion of newly trained non-healthcare professionals having completed the combined theoretical and hands-on course that passed and failed the tests, respectively. All the statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package (PASW, version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and two-sided significance levels of 0.05 were used for all analyses. Twenty-four novices without any healthcare education agreed to participate in the study and 16 experts who were registrars or consultants in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery working either at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Zealand University Hospital, Køge or Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. All 24 novices were both pre-and post-tested while the 16 experts only were tested once. In total, results from 64 URTS MCQ tests and 128 videos of OPS and NPS performance were available for assessment with the URTS checklist. The URTS MCQ and the URTS checklist items were based on the WHO recommendations and revised based on content matter expert reviews. Based on the comments by the expert review, nine of the fourteen MCQ questions were revised, and one new item was added. Item analysis showed that 12 out of 15 items had acceptable item discriminatory indices of 0.18 or above, whereas the remaining three had indices below 0.04 and were removed from the final test. Five of the 17 URTS checklist items for OPS and NPS performance were revised to the final version approved by all the experts and used for the study (see Appendix A). All MCQ tests were administered in a standardized fashion without allowing the participants any guidance. After completing a half-hour rater training, the raters were able to conduct assessments using both OPS and NPS checklists without any missing values. The two raters reported no difficulty in performing ratings in the simulated context despite dissimilarities between the simulated and clinical procedure (e.g., no head movements during insertion of swabs or interaction with the patient). The internal consistency reliability of the MCQ test was 0.76. The URTS checklist score demonstrated good inter-rater reliability for OPS and NPS skills assessment of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. Internal consistency reliabilities for both instruments were high, Cronbach\\'s alpha 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. The URTS MCQ-test score was significant higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The novices scored higher after training (p < 0.001) but still significantly lower than the experts (p = 0.008).  This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. The URTS checklist score was significantly higher for the group of experts compared to the group of novices without training, p < 0.001 for both OPS and NPS (see Table 1 ). The novices scored higher after both NPS and OPS training (p < 0.001) but not significantly lower than the experts when the OPS score (p = 0.14) and the NPS score (p = 0.49) were compared (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). The contrasting groups\\' method established an MCQ-test pass/fail score of 91% and a checklist pass/fail score of the 76% for OPS and 61% for NPS, see Figure 2 . The consequences of the standard setting were that thirteen of the trained novices failed MCQtest while only one failed the competency-based assessment with the URTS checklist (see Figure 2 and Table 1 ). This study provided validity evidence supporting the use of the developed URTS MCQ and checklist for the assessment of OPS and NPS skills. We found a high inter-test and inter-rater reliability, a significant discrimination between experts and novices\\' URTS scores, and established pass/fail scores for URTS MCQ and checklists. Sources of validity evidence were explored in this study following Messick\\'s validity framework. The content of the checklist was based on literature review and multi-speciality expert consensus. The response process was ensured by controlled testing environments, rater training, and the anatomical correct simulators used in the testing setup. A high inter-rater and inter-item reliability supported the internal structure validity evidence for both the MCQ-test and checklists. Relations to other variables were supported by the URTS MCQ and checklist ability to differentiate between novice and expert experience levels and the ability to measure an effect from 30 min training of the novices. The consequences of the test were explored by a standard setting establishing a meaningful pass/fail score. The finding that a group of trained novices did not obtain a significant lower URTS checklist score to compare to a group of experts may be surprising at first. However, previous studies have shown that experts often do not adhere strictly to detailed checklists compared with trained intermediate learners [20] although they are better at providing accurate overall diagnoses. However, COVID-testing is a relatively simple procedure requiring limited and relatively elementary knowledge and skills, which may indicate a short learning curve that combined with the standardized simulated model may have resulted in some level of ceiling effects. The good effect of a short simulation-based URTS training is also comparable to other studies with similar findings [21, 22] . This indicates that URTS is a well-defined procedure where non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts if they receive focused and standardized training [23] . In this study, we assessed both OPS and NPS performance as WHO recommends combining both samples for each case to increase the diagnostic sensitivity [3] . In contrast, CDC primarily recommends a single NPS sample while other studies have questioned the OPS sensitivity [4, 24, 25] . If a single NPS specimen is used for testing purpose, the NPS checklist can just be used, and the OPS checklist can instead be omitted. The URTS assessment was developed in relation to the urgent need during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use is not limited to coronavirus diagnostic but can also be used for other upper respiratory infectious diseases. We found a high inter-rater reliability between the nurse and otolaryngologist checklist ratings, supporting the use of nurses instead of physicians for the practical testing and training of the large groups of workers involved in mass testing. Therefore, we believe the URTS MCQ-test and checklists can be used as part of training of new health-care workers at the outpatient COVID-19 testing sites and at the hospital. Further, it can also be used for training of laypersons needed in mass-testing strategies where the limitation of health workers during a pandemic will not be able to cover the test needs. The checklist was made Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1987 7 of 10 in an OSCE format and could also be used as a part of clinical skills assessment at medical and nursing schools. The findings of the study should be interpreted in accordance with the following limitations. The study was performed in a simulation-based setting, and we cannot know if the skills are directly transferable to how they would collect URT-specimens in an outpatient test site. However, a large body of existing literature supports the use of simulation-based assessment and training of clinical skills, and numerous studies have shown good correlations between performances in the simulated and clinical setting [26, 27] . Moreover, in a clinical setting it will not be possible for the rater to see the intraoral OPS sampling technique which we instead could visualize with a video endoscope in the simulated setting for more complete assessment of sample technique (see Figure 1) . A critical part of the NPS specimen collection is whether the swab reach the nasopharyngeal wall which require an insertion length between 8-11 cm [9] . However, the rater could not directly visualize if the swab reached the nasopharyngeal wall during the test participants performance on the NPS simulator model. Nevertheless, as the model has known realistic anatomy proportions it could be seen if the swab was inserted to high and trapped before at the midturbinates instead, see Figure 1 [9, 17] . The aim of this URTS skills assessment is to ensure URT-specimens collection performance performed with correct infection control precautions. However, the URTS-skills assessment do not cover the full infection prevention and control competencies needed for health workers within infectious diseases and it should be covered by focused training and competency assessment within this area [28] . Further, the URTS-checklist focuses on the skills assessment needed for collecting specimens for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Therefore, the NPS checklist should be combined with assessment of the on-site handling of the lateral flow immunoassay if it is used as a part of competency-based training in antigen testing [29] . The use of assessment instruments with established validity evidence is a cornerstone in the provision of competency-based URT-specimen collecting training of healthcare workers during the pandemic. However, until now the training and assessment of personnel performing URT-specimen collecting have received limited attention despite its importance for overall diagnostic accuracy of the tests used. A study found that NPS simulation training significantly can improve healthcare workers\\' confidence, but the change performance was not assessed [30] . There has been a large emphasis on comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different test types (e.g., antigen vs. molecular tests) and different sampling sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal vs. oropharyngeal vs. saliva), and more focus should also be on the URT-specimen collecting technique and training [31, 32] . Future research and practice must incorporate descriptions of how the sampling procedure is performed and the test personnel are assessed and trained to ensure standardization and reproducibility of test design. This also applies to self-collected URT samples which can be an effective method for mass testing in future [33, 34] . We established validity evidence supporting the use of a theoretical and practical test for upper respiratory specimens\\' collection skills based on the recommendations by the WHO. Further, the results indicate that non-healthcare educated workers can perform URT samples comparably to experts after a short and focused simulation-based training session. This is the first step to enable competency-based training of the workers in the COVID-19 test centers as well as for health-care workers performing URT samples for other infectious diseases.

From the preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV (ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas. Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education, government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable Convolution-LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth of daily COVID-19 cases. For future works, data to be analyzed should be more detailed', 'body_text': \"worldwide [12] , which is good for the environment. Moreover, vaccine development is not sufficient, and it takes a long time to discover [13] . Therefore, urgent, largescale, and natural immunity is needed. Some technologies have been developed by using UV light [14] [15] . Based on the above evidence, we investigate how UV rays dynamically affect the spread of COVID-19 based on geographic location, pollution levels, and human activities. Multivariate time series data analysis is a better choice for analyzing the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic because it has interdependence among multiple factors over time. The classification of multivariate time series is also an emerging hot topic in machine learning [19] . Deep neural network (DNN) can capture information from big data, thus it is the best candidate to perform classification tasks [20] [21] . The ability of DNN to generate meaningful feature representations in the learning process has attracted attention in the machine learning and data science circles. In this study, we use interpretable DNN forecasts to perform multivariate time series data analysis. This explanation helps to find critical joint characteristics to predict daily cases of COVID-19 over a period of time. One study using interpretable DNN is Roy Assaf et al.'s multivariate multi-factory PV energy prediction, [24] which uses a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). This multidimensional study uses 3 data sets of COVID-19 growth and its attribution, UVs, and people mobility data. The time-series data was taken from 2020-03-22 until 2020-09-11. The selected countries are located in tropical, northern subtropical, and southern subtropical regions. Data sets of worlds confirmed COVID-19, UV index, pollution, and people mobility time series were taken from Ourworldindata [1] , Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) [2] [16] , and Google Mobility [3] , respectively. Specific data, like UV index and pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia, were taken from IndonesiaMeteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) [4] . Confirmed, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 data in Jakarta have been obtained from the Indonesia Ministry of Health [5] . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint Some countries have had their deaths continue to flatten only as they have hit their hardest stringency, such as Italy, Spain, or France. As China took harder than initial stringency, its death curve was flattened. The aforementioned data set references can be accessed to investigate the detailed definition of each factor. There are 55 countries at various scales of geographical area and population trained on DNNs to reveal its explanations. Note that all factors are normalized into the 0-1 range before feeding into DNNs. The UV index (UVIEF) is derived from the measured solar radiation in the UV spectra that arrives on the surface. It is calculated by considering the proportional contribution of UV-A and UV-B, two of the three-wavelength based types of UV is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint radiation. UV-A is characterized as the UV radiation of which the wavelength ranges from 280-315 nm, while the wavelength of UV-B is between 315 nm and 400 nm. UV spectra are captured by the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station.

This dynamical pace happened between two adjacent groups, either blue with green or green with red. Blue countries were starting to converge, and conversely, red countries were starting to emerge both at the beginning of May even though outlier countries exist. These phenomena possibly can be explained in fig.1d where daily mean UV index in red countries were monotonically decreasing as the winter comes and the opposite for blue countries. It can be suggested that there is an indication that COVID-19 is a seasonal pandemic depending on geographical locations. The key drivers to be used in human mobility analysis are community activities dynamics during a pandemic depending on geographical locations (focusing on tropical countries). After the first outbreak, human mobility has changed from before pandemic due to lockdown or outdoor activity restriction from the government. To see the effect of these restrictions, we investigate activities dynamics relative to COVID-19 growth. To realize this, Google Mobility data that provide six different activities are utilized. Those activities are grocery and pharmacy, workplaces, transit stations, retail and recreation, residential, and parks percent change from baseline. To see the effect of reducing activities intensity, we analyse the time-lagged correlation between activities dynamics and COVID-19 growth. It means that the impact of activities reductions on COVID-19 growth patterns after several days is temporally investigated. The countries to be investigated in this study are India, Brazil, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Thailand (tropical countries). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted February 16, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.13.21251683 doi: medRxiv preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted February 16, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.13.21251683 doi: medRxiv preprint percentage of change to baseline. The duration of low activities was around a month, starting from the middle of April to May 2020. After May, the increasing activities were recorded, revealing new normal life has been adapted. Fig. 2d shows weekly mean confirmed cases in Malaysia that grew starting from the middle of March 2020. However, starting from May 2020, the weekly mean confirmed cases were decreasing. Note that the number of confirmed cases here has also been normalized across all countries considered in this dataset. Fig. 2e shows that Indonesia's human mobility reached the lowest activities percent change to baseline in the middle of May 2020 and then gradually increased its percentage of change to baseline. The increasing phenomena show that the new normal life has been adapted. Fig. 2f shows weekly mean confirmed cases in Indonesia that grew exponentially since the end of March 2020 as the number of tests increased. Note that the number of confirmed cases here also has been normalized across all countries considered in this dataset. To answer the question of whether there is any correlation between the decreasing activities before new normal and weekly mean confirmed cases after the new normal, time-lagged cross correlation was carried out. .

Some other factors, like morphological and behavioral factors, influence the spread and growth of COVID-19 cases. Human activity also influences the spread and growth of COVID-19 cases via human-to-human transmission, especially in workplaces, residential, and groceries where direct human interaction is intense in closed spaces. Based on direct evidence, even though there is an indication that COVID-19 is seasonal flu where there is interchanging conditions between northern subtropical, tropical, and southern subtropical locations, some other anticipation should be taken into account: 1. The new normal life is an inevitable thing in daily life where wearing a mask, hand washing, increasing the hospital's capacity, and minimizing the number of activities that make up the crowd should be concerned. 2. Open space is safer than in a closed room with a crowd due to the UV light and air circulation. Unfortunately, the victims mostly occur in closed spaces such as groceries, residential, and workplaces. 3. For tropical countries, an abundance of UV light helps withstand the COVID-19 spread, especially in open space. There must be a good balance between activities inside and outside rooms, especially at noon, where the level UV index is high. In closed spaces like workplaces, it is suggested to expose UV rays in the room before leaving the places when the work hour ends. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted February 16, 2021.\", 'bib_entries': \"Título: For subtropical country residents, wearing a mask is compulsory while living in an open space and during the cold season.

              " 'body_text': [\"In the space of a few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way neurology is practiced around the world. In order to control the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended isolation of sick persons, quarantine for those who may been exposed to the virus and social distancing. [1] Social distancing also referred to as physical distancing meant keeping space between people outside of their homes. A distance of at least 6 feet was recommended and people were asked not to gather in large groups, avoid crowded places and mass gatherings. [2] On March 24 th , 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world's largest lockdown asking 1.3 billion Indians to stay home for 21 days to slow the spread of COVID-19. [3] The lockdown has now been extended till May 3 rd . [4] All international and national flights were suspended, as were the train and vehicular services in the cities and across state lines. In New Delhi, hospitals canceled all elective surgeries, closed in-patient epilepsy and stroke units and canceled all outpatient clinics. Patients were discharged from the hospitals. Beds especially ICU beds and other resources such as ventilators were reserved for COVID-19 patients. Physicians working in these hospitals were advised to adopt telemedicine in order to primarily maintain the continuity of care for their existing patients. A developing country like India did not have existing infrastructure to support telemedicine. Most physician neurologists in India do not have electronic health record (EHR) software. After seeing the patient, the neurologist documents the history, clinical findings, assessment and plan including prescriptions on paper (letterhead), which is then handed over to the patient. Most neurologists do not maintain copies of this letterhead for their own records. When the patient comes for a follow-up visit, he brings the original letterhead with him to maintain continuity of care. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic some hospitals in India tried to roll out vendor-supported platforms through which telemedicine could be practiced. India has the largest population of illiterate adults and many patients experienced difficulty in downloading the software and logging on to the patient portal. India leads the world in accessing the Internet by mobile phones and for the people in semi-urban and rural India, mobile phones are an easy and more economical way to stay connected than devices like laptops. India's mobile (cellular) subscriber base has reached 1,176 million in 2018. [5] WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum. [6] On February 19 th , 2014, Facebook, Inc. acquired WhatsApp. [7] Most Indians are quite savvy in use of mobiles phones and WhatsApp. It is estimated that there are more than 400 million WhatsApp users in India. The first author utilized WhatsApp as the portal to provide continuity of care to his existing neurology patients and to see new patients. Before the appointment, patients were requested to send their medical records (including prior letterhead) and neuroimaging records. The first author then would call the patient at the predetermined time on WhatsApp and use either audio-call or video-call feature to discuss the case and treatment plan. He was successful in using WhatsApp to administer and guide care during neurological emergencies such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, status epilepticus, altered mental status, transient loss of consciousness, concussion and traumatic brain injury. A patient with a large subdural hematoma with significant midline shift and subfalcine herniation was advised emergency decompressive surgery. Another patient's family with a large brainstem hemorrhage was advised against transfer to the author's hospital and to continue current care at the regional hospital. The author realized the limitations of teleneurology when he consulted on a 39-year woman with complaint of numbness of both legs for the past 3 days. Numbness had rapidly increased over 3 days to the point that she was barely able to walk. No bladder or bowel symptoms were reported. Three months ago, she had complaint of pain back of the neck and both shoulders without radiation into the arms. She had been evaluated in a regional government hospital and prescribed pregabalin. On tele-video visit, her gait was not spastic, legs in fact seemed frail. Lying down, she could barely lift her legs off the bed and was unable to hold them against gravity. The author was able to look for a sensory level by asking the patient's relative to do the sensory testing examination but was significantly hampered by inability to test for deep tendon reflexes. The patient was advised to go to the hospital for an MRI spine, nerve conduction study and a formal neurological consultation but the family declined citing fear of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital. Differential diagnoses included demyelinating neuropathy as well demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The author decided to prescribe a course of oral methylprednisolone along with Vitamin B12 supplementation. On follow-up tele-neurology consultation 7 days later, the patient reported she was better and able to walk with assistance. She was advised to follow up in person after the lockdown was over. Patients paid for the consultation through Paytm, a popular and widely used Indian e-commerce platform available in 11 Indian languages. [8] WhatsApp end-to-end encryption ensures that only you and the person you are communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. India's population is around 1.3 billion and registered trained neurologist are around 1500. The burden of neurological diseases is huge and unmet by the small number of neurologists. In a low to middle income country like India, the author found WhatsApp as the best platform to offer teleneurology services to his patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this application offers tremendous opportunities when it comes to administering neurology services, daunting challenges related to patient confidentiality, keeping patients medical information and health records secure and limitations of teleneurology in a clinical examination heavy specialty such as neurology need to be overcome to truly unleash the full potential of WhatsApp neurology.

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is the causative agent of the highly transmissible and highly pathogenic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus that has a ~30 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome which shares ~80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and ~50% sequence identity with MERS-CoV [2]. The virus encodes four structural proteins—spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as several accessory proteins [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 virion is approximately 50–140 nm in size [4,5]. The large number of homo-trimeric viral spike proteins (S) located on the surface of the virion facilitate viral entry into target cells [6]. Interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the human ACE2 receptor mediates viral cell entry, with the assistance of cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 [7,8,9]. Once the virus enters the cell, the viral RNA genome is replicated, and structural proteins are synthesized, assembled, packaged, and viral particles are released. SARS-CoV-2 can be found throughout the body in the upper airways, lungs, blood, gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, among other locations [10,11,12]. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other RNA viruses, continually mutates, and new variants frequently emerge. The emergence of new virus variants (such as Delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529 and its subvariant BA.2)) has become a new crucial point of interest in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 2022, The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Trackers have reported 81 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States, with over 990,000 total deaths [13]. Worldwide, the WHO has reported more than 515 million cases with at least 6 million deaths [14]. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is an urgent public health need for increased COVID-19 testing capacity as well as the ability to detect any potential new variants that may escape current testing regimens [15]. To meet these needs, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports the development of COVID-19 diagnostics through a multipronged approach with the goal to speed innovation in the development of COVID-19 testing. In April 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing [16]. The RADx program has four components: RADx-ATP (Advanced Technology Platforms), RADx-Tech, RADx-UP (Underserved Populations), and RADx-Rad (Radical). RADx–ATP supports the scale-up of advanced technologies that can achieve immediate and substantial increases in testing capacity through establishment of ultra-high throughput clinical\n",
            "Since the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efforts have been made worldwide to prevent infection and disease [1,2,3,4]. Since December 2020, highly effective vaccines that offer high levels of protection against severe disease have been introduced worldwide. However, they do not confer mucosal immunity preventing virus entry into the respiratory tract [1,2,3,4]. In France, national vaccination campaigns were rapidly implemented at the end of 2020 to limit hospitalizations, severe consequences, and deaths due to COVID-19 [5,6]. The initial campaign phase targeted populations at risk of severe COVID-19, but it was also rapidly implemented for health care workers (HCWs) aged > 50 years on 2 January 2021, and then for all voluntary HCWs on 6 February 2021. The vaccination schedule consisted of two vaccine doses, except for the vaccination of people who had recovered from COVID-19 within 6 months before vaccination [5,6]. When mostly mild cases of breakthrough infection were reported in different countries, there was a concern that individuals in whom the immune response to the standard vaccination schedule rapidly waned could become seriously ill if infected [7,8,9]. The waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time and a possible increased immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 variants led many countries, including France, to plan the administration of a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from September 2021 [5,10]. The first variants of concern (VOCs) appeared at the end of 2020. The Alpha variant spread rapidly in France after its introduction at the end of 2020 and became the majority variant in March 2021. The Beta and Gamma variants also circulated in the first half of 2021, although to a lesser extent. The Delta variant appeared in May 2021 and rapidly replaced the previous variants, becoming the major variant in France in July 2021 and represented more than 99% of the circulating variants from August 2021 [11].  More than two years after the beginning of the pandemic, the main priority of the scientific community remains the evaluation of the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Field data on vaccine immunogenicity are important for monitoring the performance of COVID-19 vaccination programs and for the planning of public health policy decisions. Various antigens have been studied for this purpose, but the nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) protein are the most widely studied SARS-CoV-2 antigens. A proportion of the spike-binding antibodies are likely to have neutralizing activity. Thus, numerous studies have shown a correlation between S protein binding assays and various forms of functional virus neutralization assays [12]. Although it has been suggested that neutralizing antibodies are likely to be highly important for efficient protection against reinfection and could serve as a correlate for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in\n"

More than two years after the beginning of the pandemic, the main priority of the scientific community remains the evaluation of the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Field data on vaccine immunogenicity are important for monitoring the performance of COVID-19 vaccination programs and for the planning of public health policy decisions. Various antigens have been studied for this purpose, but the nucleocapsid (N) protein and spike (S) protein are the most widely studied SARS-CoV-2 antigens. A proportion of the spike-binding antibodies are likely to have neutralizing activity.

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is the causative agent of the highly transmissible and highly pathogenic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The novel SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus that has a ~30 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome which shares ~80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and ~50% sequence identity with MERS-CoV [2]. The virus encodes four structural proteins—spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as several accessory proteins [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 virion is approximately 50–140 nm in size [4,5]. The large number of homo-trimeric viral spike proteins (S) located on the surface of the virion facilitate viral entry into target cells [6]. Interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the human ACE2 receptor mediates viral cell entry, with the assistance of cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 [7,8,9]. Once the virus enters the cell, the viral RNA genome is replicated, and structural proteins are synthesized, assembled, packaged, and viral particles are released. SARS-CoV-2 can be found throughout the body in the upper airways, lungs, blood, gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, among other locations [10,11,12]. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other RNA viruses, continually mutates, and new variants frequently emerge. The emergence of new virus variants (such as Delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529 and its subvariant BA.2)) has become a new crucial point of interest in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 2022, The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Trackers have reported 81 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States, with over 990,000 total deaths [13]. Worldwide, the WHO has reported more than 515 million cases with at least 6 million deaths [14]. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic testing is critical for slowing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, there is an urgent public health need for increased COVID-19 testing capacity as well as the ability to detect any potential new variants that may escape current testing regimens [15]. To meet these needs, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports the development of COVID-19 diagnostics through a multipronged approach with the goal to speed innovation in the development of COVID-19 testing. In April 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing [16]. The RADx program has four components: RADx-ATP (Advanced Technology Platforms), RADx-Tech, RADx-UP (Underserved Populations), and RADx-Rad (Radical). RADx–ATP supports the scale-up of advanced technologies that can achieve immediate and substantial increases in testing capacity through establishment of ultra-high throughput clinical\n",

            "The ongoing pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has devastated global healthcare and economics. For nearly two consecutive years, COVID-19 has remained a clinical challenge, dramatically ravaging public health and wealth at an unprecedent speed. For instance, as of 21 October 2021, there have been 241,886,635 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4,919,755 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), making it one of the most devastating, fastest, and deadliest coronavirus outbreaks in recent history (available at https://covid19.who.int/, accessed on 15 December 2021). Of all the vague scenarios the virus brought about, its complicated pathogenicity and epidemicity have created significant clinical challenges in the absence of a specific treatment. Control efforts were entirely focused on preventive and biocontainment measures [1,2]. Under these circumstances, in an unprecedented global effort, the birth of the most rapid, novel, and advanced state-of-the-art vaccine products in human history were recorded, including the Pfizer Biontech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca. This breakthrough has led to extensive vaccination campaigns ever witnessed. As of 20 October 2021, a total of 6,655,399,359 vaccine doses have been administered (available at https://covid19.who.int/, accessed on 15 December 2021). However, despite their high efficacy and safety, cases of potential side effects were reported. A prothrombotic syndrome in a small number of individuals after AstraZeneca vaccine administration was observed [3,4]. Unfortunately, these uncertainties have left the doors wide open for the uncontrolled consumption of alternative medicines encouraged by social media platforms and antivaccine campaigns. Misconceptions about the efficacy of the medicinal plant extracts and other food supplement have suddenly loomed on the markets and over-the-counter shelves under circumstances of reduced compliance. Consequently, other interventional approaches against the infection were reported. Among these, herbal products have been claimed to be efficacious modalities that can enhance immunity and intervene against COVID-19 [5,6]. A previous report from the WHO indicated that the rate of utilization of herbal products is variable across different countries. While they are moderately consumed in some countries, they are always administered in others. The motive for this practice is based on many factors but primarily the cultural and habitual aspects of different societies [7]. Despite limited reports on the evidence for significant efficacy of these products against COVID-19, there has been increased utilization in different populations [5,6,8,9]. Besides, increased administration of raw products has the potential risk for adverse drug–drug interactions and significant pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics with other conventional drugs, reducing the efficacies of the latter medicines [10].

            "As of March 2022, four hundred and forty-one million cases and nearly six million fatalities were recorded globally due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (1). After the second anniversary of its emergence, the disease continues its rapid spread despite the drastic preventive measures applied in all countries worldwide. In the absence of vaccines or efficient medications against this disease during the first wave, countries had no alternatives other than non-pharmacological preventive measures like lockdowns, travel restrictions, physical distancing, quarantine, and using face masks to limit the disease propagation according to their capacities (2). These measures have helped to limit the propagation of the disease; however, they seem to be insufficient to control the disease entirely, and the COVID-19 resurged in multiple waves when countries started their deconfinement (3, 4). Hence, researchers were racing against the clock to find the best strategy to fight this disease and return to normal life. In this way, herd immunity or population immunity through vaccination or immunity developed after a previous infection was one of the proposed strategies (5). Given the impossibility to achieve herd immunity through natural infection, the best approach to achieve herd immunity recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is to protect people by vaccination (6, 7). These exceptional circumstances have pushed researchers and laboratories to develop and produce different types of vaccines in a short period of about 1 year (8). In December 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had approved six vaccines types, and the mass vaccination campaign started since then (9). Currently, 35 COVID-19 vaccines are approved by at least one country, and ten vaccines are approved by the WHO (9). However, myths, speculations, misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19 vaccines and their side effects have highly influenced vaccine uptake. These factors have caused delays due to unwillingness in people to get vaccinated, leading to vaccine hesitancy (10–14). Multiples studies have reported that this hesitancy is mainly related to vaccines' safety and effectiveness; however, all approved vaccines had high efficacy levels (10–17). Nevertheless, like any other pharmacological agents, these vaccines could induce some side effects that could include flu-like symptoms (e.g. headache, fatigue and myalgia) and injection site reactions and are mostly non-serious and of short duration (18–28). Algeria started its mass vaccination campaign on December 31, 2020. The vaccines had been administered first to healthcare workers and individuals with comorbidities (29–31). Currently, the approved vaccines in the country include inactivated virus vaccines, i.e., BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac, and adenoviral vector-based vaccines, i.e., Gam-COVID-Vac, AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S (30–32).

            "Since the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efforts have been made worldwide to prevent infection and disease [1,2,3,4]. Since December 2020, highly effective vaccines that offer high levels of protection against severe disease have been introduced worldwide. However, they do not confer mucosal immunity preventing virus entry into the respiratory tract [1,2,3,4]. In France, national vaccination campaigns were rapidly implemented at the end of 2020 to limit hospitalizations, severe consequences, and deaths due to COVID-19 [5,6]. The initial campaign phase targeted populations at risk of severe COVID-19, but it was also rapidly implemented for health care workers (HCWs) aged > 50 years on 2 January 2021, and then for all voluntary HCWs on 6 February 2021. The vaccination schedule consisted of two vaccine doses, except for the vaccination of people who had recovered from COVID-19 within 6 months before vaccination [5,6]. When mostly mild cases of breakthrough infection were reported in different countries, there was a concern that individuals in whom the immune response to the standard vaccination schedule rapidly waned could become seriously ill if infected [7,8,9]. The waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time and a possible increased immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 variants led many countries, including France, to plan the administration of a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from September 2021 [5,10]. The first variants of concern (VOCs) appeared at the end of 2020. The Alpha variant spread rapidly in France after its introduction at the end of 2020 and became the majority variant in March 2021. The Beta and Gamma variants also circulated in the first half of 2021, although to a lesser extent.

            "POC IVDs show promise for many applications and have the potential to significantly change disease diagnosis and pathogen detection [82]. However, RADx-Rad awardees will need to work with commercial partners on scale-up, manufacturing, and QMS in order to move from the bench to a commercially available diagnostic test. While most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 recover fully over a period of a few weeks, some individuals continue to experience a number of symptoms long past the time when they have recovered from the initial stages of COVID-19 illness [83]. This is referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID”. While the definition of PASC is still evolving, according to the CDC it generally includes the persistence of symptoms or development of sequelae approximately 4 weeks from the onset of acute symptoms of COVID-19. A recent publication has highlighted the healthcare needs for individuals who experience multi-organ sequelae of COVID-19 beyond the acute phase of infection [83,84]. What we do not know is who is at an increased risk of developing PASC following acute COVID-19 infection. What is responsible for the shift toward PASC? And why? Are there potential biomarkers that could be assessed to predict individuals who are at risk of PASC? In various diseases, normal EV cargo content changes as diseases initiate, and progress, altering the types of proteins and RNAs that are packaged [85]. EVs have begun to show utility as a diagnostic for COVID-19 and as prognostic biomarkers for disease severity [86,87,88,89,90,91]. Using an untargeted proteomic approach, a group in Italy recently demonstrated that circulating exosomes are modulated during COVID-19 infection and may be involved in disease pathogenesis [86]. Proteomic analysis of the circulating EVs have demonstrated potential biomarkers (fibrinogen, fibronectin, complement C1r subcomponent, and serum amyloid P-component) in COVID-19 patients vs. healthy controls. These proteins were further demonstrated to be differentially regulated in COVID-19 critical vs. non-critical patients [86]. Another recent study demonstrated increased concentrations of EVs in the plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients suggesting an increased need for intercellular communication [92]. While additional studies are needed to accurately assess the contribution of EVs in COVID-19 pathogenesis, this research suggests that exosomes could be potential contributors and mitigators of pathogenesis during COVID-19 infection. However, the involvement of exosomes in PASC is still unclear. The analysis of tissue-specific EVs and their associated cargo may shed light on the intercellular signals that are critical for the shift from an acute COVID-19 infection to PASC, and the prognostic biomarkers that may signal that transition.

Similarly, receiving two doses was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of local (52.1 vs. 39.4%) and systemic (56.4 vs. 45.3%) side effects compared with receiving one dose, respectively Table 6. The participants who suffered from allergy (80.3 vs. 58.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (87.9 vs. 63.8%) had significantly higher prevalence of post-vaccination side effects compared with their counterparts who did not report these diseases. Similarly, the participants who reported taking anti-asthmatic (81.6 vs. 64%), antihistaminic (76.8% vs. 62.7%), anti-reflux (83.3 vs. 63.9%), and thyroid hormone (82.4 vs. 64%) had significantly higher prevalence of post-vaccination side effects compared with their counterparts who did not report using these medications regularly. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyse the demographic and anamnestic risk factors of post-vaccination side effects. For the inactivated virus vaccine, being a female (adjusted odds ratio “AOR”: 2.500; confidence interval “CI” 95%: 1.579–3.959), suffering from allergy (AOR: 3.487; CI 95%: 2.061–5.901) and being infected previously with COVID-19 (AOR: 2.373; CI 95%: 1.555–3.621) had significantly higher odds of experiencing post-vaccination side effects in general. Compared to the youngest age group (20–30 years-old), all age groups had higher odds for experiencing side effects. Smoking and being disease-free were associated with lower odds but without statistical significance Table 7. For the adenoviral vector vaccines, being a female (AOR: 2.503; CI 95%: 1.216–5.512) had significantly higher odds of experiencing post-vaccination side effects in general.

The survey was conducted using convenient and snowball sampling based on an online questionnaire that could marginalize individuals without access to the internet and overrepresent younger individuals who tend to spend more time with social media. Given the increase in familywise error rate across the reported statistical analyses, lack of control can be considered one of the limitations of this study findings. Another limitation is the lower number of healthcare workers who received vector-based vaccines; this could be explained by the fact that the inactivated vaccines are the most used and the most preferred vaccines by the Algerian population, as described in previous studies.

            "As members of the ecosystem, humans encounter an enormous number of microorganisms during their lifetimes. Microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, and parasites are present in the surrounding environment and within the human body. Many microorganisms, especially symbiotic bacteria which contribute to food digestion and immune development, are beneficial but a small fraction, which are termed ‘pathogens,’ can cause infectious disease (1). Infectious disease is the world’s leading cause of death, especially in low-income countries, but vaccines against pathogens effectively contribute to minimizing their impact (2). However, there are no vaccines against many dangerous pathogens. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to excess mortality in the early stages of the outbreak due to the absence of effective vaccines. The experience with the COVID-19 pandemic points to the need for innovative vaccine platforms that can be adapted quickly upon the emergence of new pathogenic outbreaks. Vaccine induces antigen-specific immune responses to a certain pathogen by exposing the pathogen’s antigen to an immune system in a safe manner. Although the responses vary by type of vaccine, vaccination can also provide partial protection against phylogenetically close variants due to the similarity of antigenic structures. However, antibody and cell-mediated responses induced by vaccination generally have no reactivity to unrelated pathogens. Moreover, vaccination is recommended ahead of pathogen circulation because adaptive immune response takes time to develop. Besides the highly selective immunologic nature of vaccines, many studies report beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs) against off-target diseases (3). Unlike traditional vaccine effects, NSEs can be elicited immediately after vaccination and sometimes are perpetuated for longer periods. Live attenuated vaccine (LAV)-induced NSEs have been beneficial to non-infectious diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer (4), but in this review, we focus on the NSEs related to infectious diseases. Also, the review covers the basic concept of superinfection and interference that are important for understanding LAV-induced NSEs. In a microorganism-enriched environment, human infection can involve multiple exogenous pathogens at the same time. Superinfection and coinfection are interchangeable terms that indicate multiple infections in a single host (5). These terms are generally used for pathogenic infections, which are distinct from harmless colonization by indigenous commensal bacteria. The latter do not produce symptoms and are seldom noticeable. Many superinfections are known to synergistically augment disease severity. Respiratory viral infection by members of Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Coronaviridae are frequently associated with secondary bacterial infection (6, 7). Post-influenza\n",

            "mostly used (40.9%); however, 31.4% reported using traditional medicines, 1.3% used yoga, and 1.7% used Chinese needles or cupping. Only 20.2% of the participants had consulted a doctor prior to using traditional medicines or dietary supplements. Regarding the efficacy, 30.3% thought that the materials used were effective to very effective in treating COVID-19. Nevertheless, an overwhelming majority of participants (87.0%) did not agree with the statement that using traditional medicines or dietary supplements can replace vising a doctor when COVID-19 is contracted. The percentage of those who did agree (13.0%) is still a considerable portion (Table 2). The mean score of all participants was 4.8 ± 4.4 out of 17 possible points, which indicates a problem regarding the knowledge and support towards the use of traditional medicines or dietary supplements in COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Age was a significant predictor of the awareness and knowledge score (p-value < 0.001). Seniors were associated with less knowledge and were more likely to use traditional medicine. In contrast to university or higher education degree holders, the middle school (p-value < 0.001) and high school diploma holders (p-value = 0.033) had significantly lower knowledge scores and a high tendency to use traditional medicines or supplements (Table 3). The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has created significant gaps in clinical management strategies, opening several doors for alternative medicines. The consumption of herbal medicine and alternative health products has been widely reported globally, either to enhance health-related outcomes or relating to claims of relieving the symptoms and severity of disease conditions. These modalities are used in the absence of effective management strategies in cases of viral infections or other drug-resistant disorders where they have often proved efficacious. A compelling example of this is the current COVID-19 pandemic, for which no effective pharmacological modalities have been validated yet and vaccination does not rule out re-infection. However, at the time of submission of this manuscript, molnupiravir appeared in news headlines as the first oral antiviral COVID treatment (available at [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02783-1], accessed on 22 October 2021 at 10:23 PM local time). The pandemic has caused serious health burdens, such as fear, anxiety, and panic, which has stimulated personal judgments on the use of alternative medicines. Food supplementations and herbal medicine are often suitable in such situations, provided they are used under medical supervision or advise, where favorable outcomes have been reported. The lack of suitable pharmacological modalities paralleled with the emergence of many drug-resistant pandemics has resulted in innovative approaches to the validation of herbal medicines. This was evident during the evolution of the SARS-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics. Widespread\n",
            "baseline demographics among the different studies and in the assessment parameters that were employed by each investigation. Moreover, previous studies have shown that much of their target population thought traditional medicine was safer and better in the management of many disorders than conventional medications [20,33,34]. Welz et al. [35] previously reported that family habits, cultural beliefs, feasibility of herbals, and their occasional good outcomes following administration reduced satisfaction with conventional drugs. In recent decades, the steady increase in herbal use and the growing sense of belief over conventional medicine has raised questions, particularly in relation to frequent adverse reactions, incompatibilities, and challenges in monitoring safety [36]. There are many serious cases of herb–drug interactions where either the therapeutic efficacy of specific medications were lost or adverse events might have occurred [37]. These situations can affect the potential benefits of the drugs in reducing the severity of COVID-19 [16]. In this study, we showed that about 80% of the target population administer alternative medical products without any medical supervision. Thus, nationwide awareness and educational campaigns are recommended to increase the knowledge and awareness about the use and quantification of these products under medical supervision. Our study is limited by the cross-sectional design and the online approach of collecting data and recruiting participants, which could be associated with selection bias. In addition, the sample is not representative of the whole population. There are also significant baseline differences between males and females, which is a potential confounder. Moreover, the estimated significant differences in the baseline characteristics among the recruited participants might also account for a potential impact on the reported outcomes. Therefore, future investigations are needed with better sampling. In this study, we assessed the knowledge and awareness about the use of different types of traditional medicines in Saudi Arabia. This study revealed that the elderly, seniors, and uneducated participants were associated with lower knowledge scores and increased utilization of alternative medicine. On the other hand, marital status, income, and previous COVID-19 were all significant predictors of the awareness and knowledge score. In total, 62.8% of the participants relied on social media for knowledge compared to only 16.6% on knowledge from health care workers. On the use of traditional medicines and supplements for COVID-19, the majority (57.8%) did not answer, 23.7% admitted regular use, and 18.5% used sometimes. Moreover, family members played a significant (28.0%) role in persuading participants to use such products while only 14.7% were advised by a nutritionist, physician, pharmacist, nurse, or health worker. Thus, educational campaigns should target portions of the population to provide\n",
            "consumption of herbals in Saudi Arabia was reported by Alkhamaiseh et al. [23]. In the aforementioned study, 94% of adult Saudis used it for general therapeutic purposes and 54% as a first-line treatment in the case of diseases despite appearance of side effects in 46% of users. Furthermore, Saudis administer herbal medicine in certain circumstances, such as pregnancy [24] and diabetes [25], with previously estimated prevalence rates of 33% and 68%, respectively. In the present study, we assessed the knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of herbal medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed that only around 23% of the study population thought that herbal medicines can reduce the chances of developing the COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, 70% believed that such treatment regimens are not better than social distancing in reducing the rates of COVID-19 infection. This is in agreement with a recent web-based study where public perceptions regarding social distancing during COVID-19 were high based on proper information from the right sources [26]. However, 23.7% of participants used herbal medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic for protection and prevention against the disease. This is consistent with a previous finding, where 22.1% of Saudis reported administration of herbal medicines [18]. On the other hand, AlNajrany et al. [19] reported that 64% of their population reported using herbal products during the COVID-19 pandemic for therapeutic and interventional purposes. Furthermore, Aldwihi et al. [27] indicated a significant increase in patients’ administration of food supplementations and herbal products post COVID-19 infection. The authors also reported that frequent administration of vitamin C, peppermint, and lemon or orange were significantly associated with a reduced odds of being hospitalized for severe COVID-19 infections. Many previous investigations have also reported on the use of known herbal medicine and food supplementation for therapeutic and preventive measures during pandemics [20,28,29,30]. Senior and non-college-educated participants were significantly less informed with lower knowledge scores, as indicated by their increased use of traditional medicine. We also found that marital status, income, and previous COVID-19 infection were all significant predictors of the knowledge and awareness scores among the target population. This is consistent with the finding of AlNajrany et al. [21], who found that elders and previous experience with the products was associated with significantly more frequent utilization of traditional medicine. Other investigations have reported increased knowledge and awareness of individuals with higher educational levels about preventive measures effective against COVID-19 [20,31,32]. Although issues on gender differences has been a controversial topic in different investigations [20,31], it was not significant in our study, which is probably due to the potential differences in the\n",
